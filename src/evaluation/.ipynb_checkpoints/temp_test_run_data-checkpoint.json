Again, incredibly important set of findings. I should also mention that hyperventilation is one way that in the laboratory anyway, or in neurosurgery units for some time, physicians would evoke seizure in seizure prone patients. The reason that works is exactly the explanation I just gave you. Seizure is a hyper excitability of the brain, not enough inhibition or suppression of the overall circuitry. So you get these waves or these storms of electrical activity.", "Neuroplasticity is our nervous system, which of course includes the brain, the spinal cord, and all the connections between the brain and spinal cord and the organs and tissues of the body, and then all the neural connections back from the organs and tissues of the body to the brain and spinal cord, so the whole thing in both directions, has the ability to change in response to experience in ways that are adaptive. That is, that allows us to do things that we could not do before.", "Neuroplasticity broadly defined is the nervous system's ability to change in response to experience. But at a cellular level, that occurs through a couple of different mechanisms. One of the main mechanisms is something called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves the strengthening of particular connections between neurons. The connection sites between neurons we call synapses. Actually, technically synapses are the gaps between those connections, but nonetheless, synapses are the point of communication between neurons and those can be strengthened so that certain neurons can talk to other neurons more robustly than they happened to before."], "evaluationCost": 0.035339999999999996}, {"name": "test_case_1", "input": "What is the role of dopamine in the body", "actualOutput": "The role of dopamine in the body is to act as a major neuromodulator that is involved in various functions such as motivation, reward processing, reinforcement learning, and movement control. Dopamine is released in different circuits within the brain, impacting functions related to goal-directed behavior, decision-making, and motivation. It plays a crucial role in driving our cravings, sense of motivation, and ability to pursue goals while also influencing behaviors related to addiction and pleasure.", "success": true, "metricsMetadata": [{"metric": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The score is 1.00 because the response accurately and completely addressed the role of dopamine in the body without any irrelevant information.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-4", "evaluationCost": 0.03687}], "runDuration": 13.738684735028073, "retrievalContext": ["I think perhaps somewhat oversimplification of how people conceptualize dopamine's role in the brain is, even though it's a major important role, is for it to be active and released during highly reinforcing experiences like sex, like really good food, like drugs of abuse. It also can get activated subdivisions of the system during painful stimuli and during aversive stimuli, which again are really important for you to be aware of to say, oh my God, that's really bad for me.", "Prefrontal cortex does many, many things, but when thinking about dopamine's role in the prefrontal cortex, that is when thinking about this mesocortical pathway, we really want to think about how dopamine is activating or changing our propensity to do certain things and get us into action or prevent us from doing certain things and prevent action. So basically you can think about the mesocortical pathway as a circuit that really governs all of the major choices that you're going to make in life about what to do and what not to do toward your goals and away from the things that you want to avoid.", "So then we have to ask ourselves, where is dopamine released in the brain and body? And what specific types of neurons is it impacting? In other words, what specific types of functions does dopamine have? So there are basically five circuits within the brain that use dopamine as the primary neuromodulator. And those five circuits engage different but related functions. So I'm going to go through them one by one relatively quickly, giving you a little bit of nomenclature and some sense of what each of those circuits looks like and what it does."], "evaluationCost": 0.03687}], "metricsScores": [], "runDuration": 0.0, "evaluationCost": 0.07221}
