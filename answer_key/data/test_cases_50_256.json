            "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"Using Cortisol & Adrenaline to Boost Our Energy & Immune System Function,\" Andrew Huberman discusses the importance of cortisol and adrenaline in regulating energy levels and immune system function. He emphasizes the benefits of optimizing cortisol release through morning sunlight exposure and leveraging short-term stress to boost immunity and learning. The podcast covers strategies for increasing energy and immune response, such as cold exposure, intense exercise, and specific breathing techniques. Huberman also explores the negative effects of chronic stress on health, including disrupted sleep and increased anxiety, and discusses the biological mechanisms behind cravings for comfort foods during stress. He provides actionable advice on how to regulate stress hormones and improve overall well-being.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: I should just remind you that most of the negative effects on your life and on the lives of others are due to people, perhaps you, I hope not, being unable to regulate their mind when they have high levels of adrenaline in their body, either because they read something in a text or a comment section. Of course, that never happens to me, but it may happen to you. Of course, it happens to me. But the idea is to stay calm in your mind so that then you can regulate your action, right? And so I think that there are these practices that one can develop over time that are really straightforward and zero cost, right? You could find any number of ways to increase your adrenaline and stay calm. And we tend to focus on things like exercise as the way that we get our energy up. But today, again, I'm talking about deliberately increasing adrenaline while staying calm mentally, because that has great utility when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events, through things that we didn't seek out. So the ability to regulate adrenaline and cortisol is about inducing them deliberately when you want to push back on infection, potential infection from bacteria or viruses.\n------------------------\n",

So they're going to bias you towards more stress in other domains. Remember, cortisol can cross the blood brain barrier. So you're going to be more prone to psychological stress. I also want to mention again again that I think there's great benefit to having a practice that perhaps you do every other day, but if you can't, maybe every third day or every other day of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body while learning to stay calm in the mind so that you learn to separate the brain body experience. You know, we hear so much about how beneficial it is to unify the brain and body that we're all out of touch with our brain and bodies. I particularly dislike claims like that or statements like that, because there's great power as we learned today in having your body activated by some sort of stimulus, cold water, or even psychological stress, but learning to stay calm in your mind.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety,\" Andrew Huberman delves into the science behind stress and emotions, exploring how to understand, manage, and leverage stress for health benefits. He explains the biology of stress, debunking myths and highlighting its role in aligning our internal state with external experiences. Huberman discusses the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, their functions, and how they can be harnessed through breathing techniques like the physiological sigh to regulate stress responses in real-time.\n\nHe also addresses the positive aspects of acute stress, such as its capacity to enhance focus and immune function, and introduces breathing exercises that can induce a beneficial stress response to combat infection. Huberman emphasizes the importance of managing medium-term stress by increasing our stress threshold through practices that dissociate the mind's calmness from the body's heightened state.\n\nFor long-term stress, he underscores the significance of social connection and its relationship with neuromodulators like serotonin, which can foster feelings of well-being\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: A lot of stress inoculation, a lot of managing medium term stress on the timescale of weeks, or maybe even a couple months. So we're not talking about years of stress. A lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold. It's about capacity. And there are very simple tools, excellent tools that will allow us to modulate our capacity for stress. And they look a lot like the tools I just described. They involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat, not to the extreme, and then when we feel flooded with adrenaline, and normally we would panic, it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally, calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response in our body. So unlike trying to unify the mind and body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way. And what would this look like? Well, this is something I actually do as a practice because I mentioned before, you can use physiological size in real time. You can use the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection if you're feeling kind of run down.\n------------------------\n"

He emphasizes that understanding the specific type of headache and its biological basis is key to selecting effective treatments. Huberman explores both pharmaceutical and natural remedies, emphasizing that many natural treatments can be as effective, if not more so, than drugs, without the side effects. He also debunks the misconception that natural treatments are not scientifically grounded, explaining that they are based on a solid understanding of headache mechanisms. The episode also covers the role of muscular tension, vasodilation, meningeal irritation, and neural and inflammatory responses in causing headaches. Huberman provides insights into how the nervous system processes pain, the importance of distinguishing between different types of headaches, and the potential treatments for each.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Ah, well, the problem there is that many pain killers have other issues as well. In particular, they can be sedative. Many of them can be habit forming or even addictive. And for many people, not all, but many people, they don't want to take drugs, whether or not they're over the counter or prescription drugs or even more natural supplement based type treatments. And they would rather use, for instance, a behavioral approach in which they can modulate, they can deliberately turn off the communication between sensory neurons and motor neurons. And it turns out those approaches exist as well. Okay, so at this point, I promise you that I'm not going to give you any more of a biology lesson in terms of pain sensing and headaches as a more conceptual phenomenon. Instead, what I'd like to do next is talk about the different types of headaches. And I think this is something that's very important and not often discussed, except for those people out there that unfortunately suffer repeatedly from certain kinds of headaches like migraine or cluster or tension headache.\n------------------------\n",

Would you want to make it such that you have the headache, but you don't perceive the headache? That is you cut off communication between the sensor and the motor so that the muscles relax. Turns out there are treatments and approaches for each and every one of those. Each and every one of those has different advantages and disadvantages. But as you can quickly see, we are going to have different types of headaches and different approaches to treating headache. But if you keep in the back of your mind that you have neurons that contract muscles to create movement or tension of muscles, remember you can turn off those neurons and allow those muscles to relax. You have sensory neurons that sense input and actually sense the pain. And you have modulatory neurons, which can allow you to adjust the relationship between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. And of course, some of you are probably screaming at me by now saying, wait, why would you ever want to deal with the motor neurons or the modulatory neurons? Wouldn't you want to just go straight to the source and just cut off the pain?\n------------------------\n",

So basically what I'm saying here is that thanks to thousands of years of acupuncture and the maps of different insertion sites, we now know, or I should say people have long known and people in the West are starting to adopt the understanding that acupuncture, yes indeed, it really does work for relieving pain. And laboratories, both in the United States, which is Chufu's, and elsewhere are starting to find the underlying mechanisms. And those mechanisms include deactivation of the pain pathways, activation of some of the parallel pathways that assist in shutting down pain or in relaxing the muscles that are causing tension type headache, as well as activation of neural pathways that impinge on organs that then cause or reduce the release of molecules into the body that give us the experience of pain. So reduced inflammation, and in many cases, increasing anti-inflammatory pathways.\n------------------------\n"

So sometimes I'm writing, but writing I think can underscore for me a desire to be compulsively productive. And I think that is inversely correlated to my happiness or sense of well-being a lot of the time. So there are many areas in my life now. So if you were to ask me what has changed significantly since the time that you wrote The 4-Hour Body, I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize, I am looking where I can very deliberately de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of well-being. Where can I de-optimize? Where can I stop measuring? Where can I stop reading books? Which areas can I ignore completely? What types of information can I just excise from my life altogether for a period of time? Delete Twitter. Stop reading about books in X related to say AI or whatever it might be. Like where can I de-optimize selectively to sort of optimize the whole? Does that make sense? Makes good sense. Yeah.\n------------------------\n",

I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Tim Ferriss. Tim Ferriss is an author, a podcaster, an investor, and is known for having a near-supernatural ability to predict the future, which has allowed him to obtain success in a huge number of different endeavors. For instance, he is a five-time number one New York Times bestselling author. But perhaps equally or more important to that, he's also exceptionally good at teaching people how to write, the entire process of writing and marketing a book. His books, The 4-Hour Chef and The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek, not only explain his own exploration of how to optimize and prioritize his time and learn particular skills, but he teaches you those skills as well. This is really what sets Tim apart. He is an exceptional learner and an exceptional teacher. And today you learn why that is, and in a characteristic Tim Ferriss way, he explains the process in a way that you can apply it.\n------------------------\n",

So are you, or were you at the time like waking up in the morning going, okay, I'm going to take a walk and think about the new, the old and the orphaned, or I'm going to take a walk or sit in a chair and think about like, what are the nerds doing right now? What are rich people doing right now? Cobbling together awkward solutions. Was that exploration a structured practice for you? Or is this just something that was the consequence of being Tim Ferriss waking up in the morning and just like leaning into that? Because I've experienced both, right? But I think a lot of us are curious. I mean, there's a lot of mystique around you. Whether you like it or not, it's there and we're not trying to pry, but is the establishment of structure for you something that's the consequence of structure in the first place?

This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success can be useful at the outset of a goal and maybe every once in a while in pursuit of that goal, but that it's not terrific for putting you in constant pursuit of that goal. Rather, foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure and all the terrible things that it's going to bring seems to be more effective. And that maps very well to what's known about the neural circuitry and the involvement of the amygdala. Focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors. Removing distractors and getting your body and brain into a mode of activation, getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure that puts you into forward motion towards your goals is absolutely key. So that's a brief summary of what I've covered up until now. There were other things too, of course, the dopamine system and the power of subjective top-down control in regulating that dopamine system. But I want to be sure to include a tool that's been especially powerful for me, that's grounded in the neuroscience research and in the psychology research.\n------------------------\n",

Rather, if you are not feeling motivated, then what the scientific literature tells us is that you actually want to spend one to three, maybe five minutes visualizing failure, visualizing how terrible you will feel if you do not achieve your goal, visualizing severe consequences, perhaps mostly of the sort like telling yourself, gosh, I set a goal, I set a 12 week block, I quantify it, I know I want to do this, here I have the time to do it and I'm simply just not doing it.\n------------------------\n",

And the general instruction is to start slow, to start with one or two, and then to find a level that you're comfortable with that doesn't create an excessive feeling of warmth in the stomach, that doesn't throw off your digestion. So it takes a little bit of experimentation. Again, definitely talk to your healthcare provider before exploring this, but this has become a very common practice for people with autoimmune disorders and accessing the gut because it is accessible by taking things has also become way in which people with various mental conditions are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing. Along these lines, I do want to mention that there are studies that show that people that supplement with a lot of probiotics or even prebiotics can sometimes experience brain fog.\n------------------------\n",

Now, hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you. They literally can melt away skin. You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly. But hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form, in capsule or pill form. And there is a practice of starting to ingest one or two hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal. And then what people will generally do is examine to see whether or not that improves their symptoms of indigestion, how it relates to mood, how it relates to wellbeing, how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera. By changing the acidity, you also change the way that the gut communicates with the brain through the mechanisms we talked about before. And there are a growing number of people embracing these practices of taking HCL. It's often combined with other things. It's usually combined with an enzyme, and that enzyme is pepsin.\n------------------------\n",

Only if their homocysteine is persistently elevated. And homocysteine is kind of like an inflammatory marker that can build up if you're not converting enough of it downstream. How would I know? Just a blood test. Or if you knew your MTHFR polymorphism, which is basically how you add methyl groups to many things in the body. Great. Any side effects of betaine that people should be aware of? Not that I know of. Okay. People can look it up on examine.com is a great site for that. They'll surely list it. They just revamped their site, by the way, and it was awesome before and it's platinum now. So L-carnitine, what are the ways to take L-carnitine? I know that there's an oral form, so capsules, and there's injectables. The injectables, I think you need a prescription. Is that right? Correct.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In this episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the comprehensive effects of alcohol on the body, brain, and overall health. He explains that alcohol is consumed by humans and animals primarily because of the pleasurable effects it can induce. The episode delves into the impact of alcohol at cellular, organ, and systemic levels, including its influence on behavior and cognition when inebriated. Huberman addresses common questions about the health implications of low to moderate drinking compared to abstinence or heavy consumption. He also discusses strategies to mitigate hangover effects and the genetic differences that influence alcohol metabolism and the risk of developing alcoholism. The episode emphasizes that while alcohol can temporarily alleviate stress and elevate mood, chronic intake\u2014even at low levels\u2014can lead to increased baseline stress, reduced mood, and changes in neural circuits that may encourage further drinking. Huberman clarifies that the podcast provides information without judgment, aiming to empower informed decisions about alcohol consumption.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And we've been talking about some of those effects, effects like reducing the amount of stress. I mean, how many times have we heard somebody say, oh, I need a drink and then they have a drink and they're like, calm down. Now they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work. They can start to think about things in a maybe more grounded or rational way, or at least they believe that, or they can somehow just relax themselves. Well, while that very well may be true, that it can relax them, when they are not drinking, that level of cortisol that's released at baseline has increased substantially. Again, this relates to a defined neural circuit between brain and body, and it has to do with the ratio of cortisol to some of the other hormones involved in the stress response. We'll provide a reference to the study that describes how all of this works for those of you that really want to delve into it. But let's go back to this issue of those who are prone to alcoholism versus those who are not. Remember, there are people who have genetic variants that meaning genes that they inherited their parents, that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.\n------------------------\n",

Well, those people experience changes in their hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis that result in more cortisol, more of this so-called stress hormone being released at baseline when they are not drinking. This is really important. People who drink a bit, and when I say a bit, I don't mean one or two sips or even a glass of wine every once in a while. I mean, again, people that are maybe having one drink a night with dinner and maybe on the weekend, a few more. Again, I offer a bunch of different patterns to explain how it could also be two or three drinks on Friday or six drinks only on Saturday. Well, all of those groups experience increases in cortisol release from their adrenal glands when they are not drinking. And as a consequence, they feel more stressed and more anxiety when they aren't drinking.

He explains the importance of understanding fertility for everyone, not just those looking to conceive, as it relates to overall vitality and longevity. Huberman delves into the menstrual cycle in females, describing its orchestration for potential fertilization and its impact on brain and body behavior. For males, he discusses spermatogenesis and the journey sperm take to reach and fertilize the egg. The episode also covers actionable tools for enhancing fertility, including behavioral changes, nutrition, supplementation, and medical interventions for hormone or neurotransmitter production issues. Huberman emphasizes that knowledge of fertility processes can contribute to maximizing health and lifespan, regardless of one's desire to have children.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So you can just go to hubermanlab.com, put into the search function, stress tools, and a bunch of different links will pop up related to those topics. Likewise with sleep, likewise with any number of different topics you might be interested in. So get enough quality sleep and thereby reduce stress and also directly buffer stress with real-time tools to buffer stress that I've talked about in the episodes that you can access. And there are ways to greatly reduce your overall level of stress to limit any cortisol that's released early in the day, which is when you want cortisol released and not have it late in the day and so on and so forth. So reduce your stress. And as I just told you, by all means, do not drink more than two drinks per week and zero is better than two. If anyone tells you, oh, well, there's, you know, all this resveratrol in red wine and that's good for us, the data simply tell us that there's not enough resveratrol in red wine to really have any positive health benefit. The data around resveratrol and health benefits itself is under question nowadays. Zero alcohol is better than any alcohol.\n------------------------\n"

Although commonly associated with blood pressure, sodium plays a broader role in health and performance, including athletic and cognitive functions, aging, and dementia. Huberman explores how the brain regulates our salt appetite and aversion, and how the perception of saltiness can influence sugar cravings and consumption. He presents the idea that for some, more salt might enhance health and functioning, while for others, less is beneficial. Huberman emphasizes consulting with a physician before altering salt intake and outlines the neurobiology and hormonal biology involved in salt regulation, touching on liver and kidney function as well as brain function. He also highlights a study on gut sensor cells that can distinguish between caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, emphasizing the subconscious influence of gut sensors on cravings.

Dr. Balcetis explains that how we perceive a goal\u2014whether we see it as close or far, easy or difficult\u2014can significantly influence our energy levels and strategy when approaching it. Her research has shown that narrowing our visual focus, as if through a spotlight, can create the illusion that a goal is closer, making it feel more attainable and less daunting. This technique has been found to increase speed and efficiency in physical tasks and reduce the perceived effort required. Dr. Balcetis discusses the importance of not only setting goals but also planning for obstacles and creating actionable steps to overcome them.

            "\nShow Summary: In episode 47 of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the science of gratitude and its profound impact on mental and physical health. He debunks the common misconception that an effective gratitude practice merely involves listing things one is thankful for. Instead, he highlights neuroimaging and physiological data that suggest a different approach is necessary. Huberman emphasizes that receiving gratitude can significantly activate neural circuits associated with health benefits. He also explores the concept of \"theory of mind\" and its relation to pro-social behaviors. The episode delves into how narrative stories of gratitude can synchronize physiological responses, such as heart rate, among listeners. Huberman also explains how gratitude practices can reshape neural circuits, reducing anxiety and increasing motivation. Additionally, he touches on neurochemical aspects, specifically serotonin's role in enhancing pro-social behaviors and how certain supplements might influence gratitude practices. Lastly, Huberman suggests a practical gratitude practice framework, including frequency and timing, to harness these benefits.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Taking a substance that increases a neurochemical in your brain will likely, provided it's the right substance and it's the right practice, will likely enhance the amplitude or the intensity of that practice and make it a more potent form of inducing neuroplasticity, meaning it will create longer lasting or more robust brain changes than if one hadn't increased their chemistry in this way, this way of taking something. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you couldn't get to the very same place without it by simply doing a slightly longer gratitude practice or putting a little bit more mental effort into it. That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity really resides in not just one approach, not just neurochemistry and taking substances to increase neuroplasticity, not just behavioral practices to try and increase neuroplasticity, not just brain machine interfaces or devices to increase neuroplasticity, but rather the convergence of multiple tools. So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission, as we say in the brain, using something like KANA combined with a gratitude practice in the not too distant future. This will probably also be combined with some sort of non-invasive device to stimulate the prefrontal cortex at the same time.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the episode titled \"Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind\" of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Karl Deisseroth, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Stanford School of Medicine. They discuss the groundbreaking work of Dr. Deisseroth's lab in developing optogenetics, a technique using light to control neurons, which has transformative potential for understanding and treating psychiatric disorders. They explore the implications of this technology for conditions like depression, OCD, autism, and blindness. Additionally, they delve into the future of psychiatric treatment, the challenges of specificity in medication, and the potential for non-invasive treatments informed by optogenetic research. Dr. Deisseroth also shares insights on the art and science of psychiatry, the importance of understanding patients' experiences, and the potential for brain-machine interfaces in mental health treatment.\nShow Guest: Dr. Karl Deisseroth\nTranscript: Are these opening up new paths or representations of paths into the future? MDMA, ecstasy, is a unique compound in that it leads to big increases in brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. And I realize that the neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin often work in concert, not alone, the way they're commonly described in the more general popular discussions. However, it is a unique compound and it's different than the serotonergic compounds like LSD and psilocybin. And there are now data still emerging that it might be, and in some cases can be useful for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and similar things. Why would that work? And a larger question, perhaps the more important question is psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those compounds, in my mind, there are two components. There's the experience you have while you're on them. And then there's the effect they have after. People are generating variations of these compounds that are non-hallucinatory variations.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 103, Andrew Huberman discusses the neural mechanisms and processes that underlie creativity. He explains that creativity is not just an abstract concept but is rooted in specific neural circuits that can be activated in a particular sequence to foster creative thinking. Huberman emphasizes that everyone has the capacity for creativity as it stems from a subset of neural structures in the brain. He outlines that creativity involves both divergent thinking, which is generating a wide range of ideas from a single starting point, and convergent thinking, which is narrowing down those ideas to find the most useful and novel ones.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in creativity, highlighting two key pathways: the nigrostriatal pathway, which is associated with divergent thinking and movement, and the mesocortical pathway, which is associated with convergent thinking, motivation, and emotion. He suggests that open monitoring meditations can help enhance divergent thinking by allowing for the free flow of thoughts without judgment,\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, there are forms of pharmacology that can shift brain neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in ways that favor creativity. And this is certainly a topic that we will go into in more depth in a future episode, but there's an exciting study that was performed just this last year, looking at the role of serotonin, another neuromodulator, in divergent and convergent thinking. And it turns out that serotonin underlies a lot of the brain activity that's responsible for both divergent and for convergent thinking. And there's one particular form of pharmacology, which can enhance activation of the serotonergic pathways associated with the so-called 5-HT, that's serotonin, 5-HT, that's the abbreviation, 5-HT2A receptor, serotonin 2A receptor in particular brain areas in ways that favor both divergent and convergent thinking. And the pharmacologic agent in that case turns out to be very low dose, or as some of you may have heard of it referred to as micro dosing of psilocybin.\n------------------------\n"

There is this idea, and I'll say it so that you don't have to, that dates back to Lamarck and Lamarckian evolution, very controversial, right? And maybe not even controversial. I think it's very like offensive even to certain people. This idea of inheritance of acquired traits, the idea that one could change themselves through some activity, use the example of going to the gym. We could also use the example of somebody who becomes an endurance runner, then decides to have children within another endurance runner and has in mind the idea that because they did all this running and not just because they were biased towards running in the first place, but because of the distance they actually ran that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners. Okay, this Lamarckian concept is, we believe, wrong. So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits? What's the proper language for us to frame this discussion? Right.

Dr. Rech\nShow Guest: Dr. Oded Rechavi\nTranscript: How specific can it be? Does it make sense for it to be specific? And in the case of C. elegans, the response can be very specific through this inheritance of RNAs, which are just sequence specific. They downregulate, they control one particular gene. In other cases, it could be a very general response. And it's very interesting to think about it when we talk about inheritance of memories, which is the most interesting thing we could imagine. Can brain activity of some sort transmit, at least in these worms? I said, Noah, I said this disclaimer multiple times in members we don't know, times will tell. In worms we know a lot. So can worms transmit brain activity to, do they have the specificity to do it? Okay. Before I'll say that, I'll just say that we over the years learned a lot about the mechanisms that shuttle the RNAs between generations. We know about genes that are needed just for that. About worms, it would be perfectly okay, but just don't have the capacity to transfer the RNAs to the next generations. We know about genes that will make the responses longer or shorter.\n------------------------\n"

There are other languages that have very, very few. For example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian has an inventory of about 12 to 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants and vowels. English, on contrast, has about 40 different consonants and vowels. So languages have different inventories. They can overlap for sure, but different languages use different sound elements, combine and recombine those elements to give rise to different words and meanings. Can we say that there is a most complicated language out there or among the most complicated, would it be Russian? It's definitely high up there. English is up there too, actually. Yeah, German as well. And in terms of learning multiple languages during development, my understanding is that if one wants to become bilingual or trilingual, best to learn those languages simultaneously during development, ideally before age 12, if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later. Is that correct? Or do you want to revise that? Well, basically the earlier and the earlier is better, the more intense it is and the more immersive it is.\n------------------------\n",

And one point I want to make about it is this, is that in English, for example, there are about 40 different phonemes. Phonemes are just consonants or vowels or individual speech segments. But these articulatory features that you refer to, for example, the characteristic sounds that are generated by specific movements in the mouth, you can more or less reduce that to about 12 different features. Okay, these are specific movements of the tongue, the jaw, the lips, the larynx. There are about 12 of these movements. And just like you said, Andrew, by themselves, they have no meaning. They're just movements. But what's incredible about it is that you take these 12 movements and you put them in combinations and you start putting them in sequence. We as humans use those 12 set of features to generate all words. And because we can generate nearly an infinite number of words with that code of just 12 features, we have something that generates essentially all possible meaning. Because that's what we do as humans. We generate meanings.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode 87 of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Erich Jarvis, a neurobiologist exploring the complexities of vocal learning, speech, and language. Dr. Jarvis's work investigates the genetic and neural underpinnings of how species like humans, songbirds, and parrots acquire and produce language, including the ability to learn and articulate complex vocalizations. They discuss the intricate relationship between speech, language, and movement, such as dance, and how these elements are intertwined both biologically and cognitively. They also delve into the idea that reading engages sub-perceptual motor activity in the throat, reflecting internalized speech. The conversation covers the potential evolutionary pathway from innate vocalizations to learned speech and the concept of critical periods for language acquisition. Dr. Jarvis's research suggests that the brain regions associated with speech production may have evolved from those involved in controlling body movement, leading to the unique human capacity for sophisticated language and even the ability to dance\nShow Guest: Dr. Erich Jarvis\nTranscript: And so you narrow down the ones you use to string the phonemes together in the words that you learn, and you maintain those phonemes as an adult. And here comes along another language that's using those phonemes or in different combinations you're not used to. And therefore, it's like starting from first principles. But if you already have them in multiple languages that you're using, then it makes it easier to use them in another third or fourth language. I see. Incredible. So it's not like your brain has maintained greater plasticity. It's your brain has maintained greater ability to produce different sounds that then allows you to learn another language faster. Got it. Are the hand gestures associated with sounds or with meanings of words? I think the hand gestures are associated with both the sounds and the meaning. When I say sound, like if you are really angry, right, and you are making a loud screaming noise, right, you may make hand gestures that look like you're going to beat the wall, right? Because you're making loud sounds and loud gestures, all right?\n------------------------\n"

So if you're trying to learn anything at all, I do encourage you to explore motor training and visualization because basically all the studies out there, in fact, I couldn't find one exception where some degree of improvement wasn't observed when people use motor training and visualization on a consistent basis, even just the three to five times per week, these simple repeats over and over. So I don't want to overcomplicate or make it sound like mental training and visualization has to be performed in a very precise way or that it has to be done perfectly each and every time.

However, when it comes to learning and improving performance in the cognitive or physical domain, they are not equivalent. So this is the second principle of mental training and visualization. As you recall, the first principle of mental training and visualization was that in order to make it effective, it needs to be very brief and very simple and repeated over and over again. The second principle of mental training and visualization is that while yes, mental training and visualization recaptures the same patterns of neural firing in the exact same ways as real world behavior and thinking, it is not as effective as real world behavior and thinking. In other words, if you want to learn something, the ideal situation is to combine real training in the physical world with mental training. And I'll talk about exactly how to do that and in what ratios a little bit later.\n------------------------\n",

And in doing so, we can really stamp down a third principle of mental training and visualization, which is that your mental training and visualization will be far more effective if you are performing the exact same or very similar mental and physical tasks in the real world. Okay, so first principle is mental training and visualization needs to be simple and brief and repeated. Second is that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world motor training or cognitive training. It's an augment. It's an addition that can really help. And the third principle of mental training and visualization is that you need to combine mental training and visualization with real world behaviors and experiences that are very, very similar. Now as a brief, but I think really relevant aside, one of the things that also makes mental training and visualization more effective is when we assign cognitive labels to what's going on when we visualize.\n------------------------\n"

Do a task in the real world, do 50 trials of the imagined task, do the trial in the real world again. Significant improvement in speed and accuracy through now what are becoming to be established neural circuit connections between cerebellum and primary motor cortex. Okay, so this study is one of several, but not a tremendous number of studies out there that are starting to really pinpoint the underlying neural circuits that allow mental training and visualization to really improve motor skill performance. But again, and please hear me on this, in this study and in the vast majority of other studies that have shown significant improvement in motor performance in the real world by use of mental training and visualization, there was an ability of each and every one in the study to perform the specific motor sequence in the real world that then they were able to enhance with mental training and visualization. Now, thus far, we've been talking mostly about performance of motor sequences. And one of the things to really understand about performance of motor sequences, both in the real world and in the imagined context is that it involves the doing, that's what we call a go action and not doing certain things.\n------------------------\n",

What's been shown over and over again in this literature is that performing mental training and visualization repeatedly and in a very restricted way that makes it easier to perform those trials over and over and over again, and with a high degree of accuracy, almost always, really we can fairly say in essentially every study where it's been explored has led to improvements in real world performance of both cognitive and or physical tasks. So if you're trying to learn anything at all, I do encourage you to explore motor training and visualization because basically all the studies out there, in fact, I couldn't find one exception where some degree of improvement wasn't observed when people use motor training and visualization on a consistent basis, even just the three to five times per week, these simple repeats over and over. So I don't want to overcomplicate or make it sound like mental training and visualization has to be performed in a very precise way or that it has to be done perfectly each and every time. Quite to the contrary.\n------------------------\n",

I misspoke in the sense that, again, I said, for the thing that you're trying to learn, remember mental training and visualization is going to be most effective for building up the number of accurate trials or your ability to do something with a greater frequency of something that you're already capable of doing or have done at least once in the real world. This is not to say that mental training and visualization can't be used to acquire new skills. It can in principle, but it has been shown to be most effective for enhancing the speed and the accuracy of skills that one has already demonstrated some degree of proficiency at in the real world. I think that's important to point out because we often hear mental training visualization and this equivalence of perceptual and motor experiences in our mind's eye to the real world. And we think, oh, all we have to do is imagine doing something and we will get better at it. And unfortunately that's not the case.\n------------------------\n"

So they are prone to concussions and head injuries simply by virtue of their work without any millions of dollars contracts or the opportunity to necessarily, in some cases they do, but necessarily to do other things. And certainly car accidents or bicycle accidents are not voluntary events. So the point being traumatic brain injury and headache related traumatic brain injury extends far beyond the realm of sports. And in fact, if you were to look at the numbers, what you find is that more than 90% of traumatic brain injury, so people coming into the hospital or clinic or people claiming that they've got consistent headaches, they're not sleeping well, their mood is off, they're feeling more irritable after having hit their head even once, is not the consequence of sports. It's going to be the consequence of accidents either at the workplace or in terms of a bicycle or other sorts of transportation-based accident, like a car accident.\n------------------------\n",

Keeping in mind, of course, that football is this very salient example of traumatic brain injury and concussion as is boxing, as is even soccer with heading of the ball, believe it or not, repeated low level impact to the forehead and other parts of the head can give rise to over time traumatic brain injury without the need for any kind of full-blown concussion or being quote unquote knocked out. But sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion. Most traumatic brain injury and concussion and low level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become traumatic for sake of daily living, that is lowered cognition, disruption in mood, sleep, et cetera, is actually the consequence of things other than sports. So for instance, bicycle accidents, playground accidents, construction accidents, and this is often forgotten. And for some reason, all the sports and in particular football tend to grab all the attention as it relates to concussion.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode featuring Dr. Matthew MacDougall, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink, the discussion delves into the company's aims to develop technologies that can address clinical challenges of the brain and nervous system, as well as enhance brain function. Neuralink combines neuroscience, neurosurgery, robotics, machine learning, and novel devices to potentially treat diseases like Parkinson's and to augment human cognition and memory. Dr. MacDougall shares insights on brain function from a neurosurgeon's perspective, and the conversation explores the future of brain augmentation, including the use of peripheral devices like a radio receiver implanted in Dr. MacDougall's own body. The episode also touches on the potential of Neuralink's technology to enable quadriplegics to control digital devices and eventually reconnect their brains to their bodies.\nShow Guest: Dr. Matthew MacDougall\nTranscript: And it's not football and hockey. For some reason, football and hockey and boxing get all the attention. But my colleagues that work on traumatic brain injury tell me that most of the traumatic brain injury they see is somebody slips at a party and hits their head or is in a car accident or environmental accidents of various kinds. To my mind, most helmets don't actually cover this region close to the eyes. So is there also a failure of helmet engineering that, you know, I can understand why you'd want to have your peripheral vision out the sides of your eyes, periphery of your eyes, but it seems to me if this is such critical real estate, why isn't it being better protected? You know, I'm no expert in helmets, but I don't think we see a lot of epidural hematomas in sports injuries. To get this kind of injury, you usually need a really focal blunt trauma, like the baseball bat to the head is a classic mechanism of injury that would lead to a temporal bone fracture and epidural hematoma. With sports injuries, you know, you don't often see that, especially in football with, you know, a sharp, sharper object coming in contact with the head.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"Science-Supported Tools to Accelerate Your Fitness Goals,\" host Dr. Andrew Huberman and guest Dr. Andy Galpin discuss science-based strategies for enhancing fitness routines. The episode covers a wide range of protocols including how to structure a fitness regimen and integrate recovery, nutrition, and supplementary measures to augment strength, hypertrophy, endurance, anaerobic capacity, and more. Huberman highlights select protocols he has incorporated into his routine that are fun and time-efficient and encourages listeners to tailor these strategies to their goals without significantly increasing workout duration.\n\nKey components of any fitness program consist of a combination of cardiovascular and resistance training sessions. The episode emphasizes the necessity of including different training types (like zone two cardio, strength sessions, and different cardiovascular workouts) and recovery to make continuous progress.\n\nSpecific tools discussed include \"meshing\" zone two cardio with daily activities, like walking, to hit the recommended 200 minutes per week without additional scheduling.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Now, the one exception to this that I incorporated was that for very small muscle groups, so for instance, the rear deltoids, or for neck work, or for calf work, to not rely purely on three to five repetitions, but maybe to work in a range of anywhere from five to eight repetitions. So still fairly low repetitions, but not so low that it restricts you to three to five repetitions. The reason for that is that I, and I think a lot of people out there, find it hard to fatigue those smaller muscle groups adequately with good form when restricting oneself to those low repetitions. However, for big compound movements like presses and squats and deadlifts and glute ham raises and things of that sort, maybe even leg extensions and leg curls, which are isolation exercises, of course, to really restrict oneself to those three to five repetition ranges that take you to failure or near failure. I listed off the benefits of doing that that I experienced, and I'm confident that you will also experience a lot of benefits. So just to remind you what some of those benefits are, you get stronger, which feels great. That occurs within your weight workouts, but it also carries over to your endurance training sessions.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab guest series episode with Dr. Andy Galpin, they discuss the science and methods to increase strength, hypertrophy (muscle growth), and endurance. Dr. Galpin highlights the importance of strength and hypertrophy training for everyone, not just athletes, as it combats neuromuscular aging and preserves muscle function. He clarifies that strength training is essential for maintaining muscle power and strength, which is crucial for everyday movements and preventing falls as we age. The conversation also touches on the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training for cognitive function, immune health, and overall longevity. Dr. Galpin dispels misconceptions about strength training, emphasizing that it can be started at any age and is not solely for building muscle mass, but also for maintaining functional abilities. He also discusses the neuromuscular adaptations that occur with strength training, such as improved nerve firing, muscle contractility, and changes in muscle fiber type.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: But in reality, if it is, you can do whatever you would like. Tell me if this is a reasonable structure, given what you've told us. Three exercises per muscle group. First exercise, slightly heavier loads. So repetition ranges somewhere between, let's say, five and eight, with perhaps hitting failure or close to it on the last set rest periods of somewhere between two or let's, let's get wild and say five minutes. Okay. So it's a little bit more of a strength type workout at that point, but then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets where the repetition ranges now eight to 15, shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so. And then on the third exercise, repetition ranges of 12 to 30. This number 30 kind of makes me wide-eyed when I think about it. I can't remember the last time I did a set of 30 thinking it was for hypertrophy, but what you're saying makes absolute sense and is research-backed. So very short rest intervals, maybe 30 seconds between sets. Would that allow somebody to target all three forms of major adaptation? I mean, in my mind it works.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast #94 titled \"Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health,\" Andrew Huberman discusses science-based tools to optimize physical health, covering various fitness aspects such as endurance, strength, flexibility, hypertrophy, and more. He proposes a general fitness protocol that individuals can adapt to pursue specific fitness goals such as increased strength or endurance. Huberman outlines his workout schedule, emphasizing training large muscle groups like legs and adjusting for recovery and biomechanical safety with activities such as heat-cold contrast sessions for recovery.\n\nThe podcast also explores the benefits of long endurance workouts, the importance of resistance training coupled with tailored sets and repetitions for hypertrophy or strength gains, and the significance of incorporating neck exercises for overall stability and safety. Huberman reinforces the necessity of balancing fitness types throughout the week, providing a foundation for full-body health.\n\nAdditionally, he announces the launch of the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel, offering in-depth responses to listener questions and exclusive content.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So it might be anywhere from three to four sets per exercise. Again, still just two exercises and longer rest between sets, anywhere from two minutes to maybe even four minutes if it's really heavy leg work. And then for the next month, switch to repetition range that's closer to eight to 12, maybe even 15 repetitions per set, but do fewer sets overall. So maybe just two to three sets per exercise, again, just two exercises per muscle group typically. And shorten the rest between sets so that it's more in the 90 second, maybe even as short as 60 seconds rest between sets, but typically 90 seconds to about two minutes or two and a half minutes. So basically it's one month heavier, the next month slightly lighter, although I wouldn't say light, I would say moderate weight and moderate rep range. That tends to work well for me. It also adheres to a principle that came up during the discussion, again, with Dr. Andy Galpin, that for hypertrophy, you really can use repetition ranges anywhere from five to 30, three zero reps. But he emphasized changing the repetition ranges in order to offset boredom.\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Balcetis explains that how we perceive a goal\u2014whether we see it as close or far, easy or difficult\u2014can significantly influence our energy levels and strategy when approaching it. Her research has shown that narrowing our visual focus, as if through a spotlight, can create the illusion that a goal is closer, making it feel more attainable and less daunting. This technique has been found to increase speed and efficiency in physical tasks and reduce the perceived effort required. Dr. Balcetis discusses the importance of not only setting goals but also planning for obstacles and creating actionable steps to overcome them. The conversation highlights the power of vision as a tool for enhancing motivation and the practical applications of this research for everyday goal achievement.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balcetis\nTranscript: But is there a kind of a higher level, kind of a black belt version of what we're talking about here, where not only am I focusing on a specific visual location as an intermediate or a long-term goal, or I'm using an app to ask me a question and tap into how I'm feeling, create a visual representation of my motivational state, but that I'm also making my phone as bright as possible. I'm also trying to take that visual window and actually pay attention to more of the details at that location. Or is it simply a matter of kind of, in geek speak visual neuroscience, we would just call this like low spatial frequency, just sort of grabbing a black and white snapshot of something here or there in my mind. If I attach more detail and effort to the specific thing that I'm focused on, is there any evidence that that's more effective? It certainly, you know, changes what our brains are doing. So, you know, how do we define effectiveness? That's a question for philosophers and that scientists will always- Will it keep me running? Yeah. It will when you use it towards the end of your run, just like you've picked up on. Yeah.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And so next we're going to talk about what the literature says about things like visualization, immediate and intermediate goals, long-term goals, and how to best achieve those. And then we're going to move specifically into the protocols that you can use. It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you, the listeners, in order to incorporate all the signs into a best practice that you can do anytime, any place to really identify what it is specifically that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal. Focusing our visual attention on one particular point is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit. And if you'd like to read some of the scientific studies or read a review of the scientific studies that have looked at how narrowing one's visual attention can really enhance the effectiveness of pursuing goals, I'll put a link to this study. The title of the study is Keeping the Goal in Sight, Testing the Influence of Narrowed Visual Attention on Physical Activity. And this is a paper from Emily Balsettis' lab. It focuses mainly on physical activities, but it mentioned some other things as well. This is an article published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin in 2020.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Goals Toolkit: How to Set & Achieve Your Goals\" episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses strategies for setting and achieving personal goals. He emphasizes the importance of selecting specific, challenging goals and outlines a 12-week plan to work towards them. Dr. Huberman advises against multitasking goals and suggests focusing on one primary goal at a time. He also dispels myths about goal setting, such as the effectiveness of visual reminders and announcing goals for accountability. The episode highlights the neuroscience behind goal pursuit, including the role of the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Dr. Huberman provides practical tools for initiating and sustaining motivation, such as visual target training, which involves focusing on a point to increase alertness and motivation. He also recommends removing distractions, like turning off phones during goal pursuit sessions, and understanding how to manipulate dopamine levels to maintain motivation.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balchettis\nTranscript: And it allows you to increase your level of focus, your level of motivation, and the sustainability of your focus and motivation while in goal pursuit. So it's a quite valuable protocol to incorporate, and it's something that you can do once for 30 seconds and then lean into whatever it is, your writing process, your running process. It's something that you could do repeatedly throughout that learning bout, and it's something that you can practice offline a little bit away from that training bout as a means to sort of learn and get familiar with so that then you can incorporate it very quickly and repeatedly and with much more effectiveness during these different learning bouts. Again, it's a highly valuable tool that's grounded in neural circuitry, grounded in neurochemistry, and that Emily Balchettis' lab has shown in numerous domains, physical pursuits, cognitive pursuits can really help people achieve their goals and to achieve them more easily, or at least with less perceived effort and more quickly. Now we can get a bit more granular about the incorporation of this tool, this protocol, but before we do, we should acknowledge that all of the things that lend themselves to improved cognitive focus and physical ability still hold true, right?\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: The episode \"How to Focus to Change Your Brain\" from the Huberman Lab podcast, hosted by Andrew Huberman, delves into the science of neuroplasticity\u2014the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience. Huberman explains that neuroplasticity is not just for children; adults can also rewire their brains with the right practices and conditions. He emphasizes the importance of focused attention, alertness, and the use of certain neurochemicals like epinephrine and acetylcholine to facilitate plasticity. Practical advice is given on how to improve focus, including managing sleep, motivation, and practicing visual focus. Huberman also touches on the use of pharmacology, like caffeine or nicotine, to enhance alertness and cholinergic transmission, which can aid in the neuroplasticity process. The episode provides insights into how we can harness our brain's plasticity to learn and adapt at any age, given the right conditions and practices.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Spending just 60 to 120 seconds focusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen, meaning just on my screen with nothing on it, but bringing my eyes to that particular location increases not just my visual acuity for that location, but it brings about an increase in activity in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated with gathering information from this location. So put simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus, practice visual focus. Now, if you wear contacts or you wear corrective lenses, that's fine. You of, would want to use those. You don't want to take those off and use a blurry image. The finer the visual image and the more that you can hold your gaze to that visual image, the higher your levels of attention will be. Many times on Instagram, and here I've been teased for not blinking very often. That's actually a practiced thing. We blink more as we get tired, which as you hear it, you'll probably just say, duh. As we get tired, the neurons in the brainstem that are responsible for alertness and that hold the eyelids open start to falter and our eyelids start to close.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So what is special about focusing one's visual attention at a given location? Well, it turns out that we have two branches of our visual system. So visual information all comes in through our eyes, but then it can head down two different pathways. One pathway is engaged when our vision is brought to a common point, what we call a vergence eye movement. So if we're focusing very intensely on a given point, regardless of how far away from us that point is, our visual system engages a certain set of neurons, neural circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail and that can evaluate small changes over small periods of time. Just think of it as a very detailed camera of the visual world. And it tends to be very restricted. The other pathway through the visual system is a so-called Magnocellular pathway. And this is a pathway that's involved in taking in global information about lots of things that are happening around us, movement of things to our right, movement of things to our left, things that are happening down on the ground and all around us. And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will, of the neural circuits that are associated with alertness and attention.\n------------------------\n"

For years, I had the same recurring nightmare over and over and over again. And it was so salient and so clear. And I'm not going to share what it is because it's not that it's that disturbing. It was just, I think it was the emotional load of it and just how salient certain features were. Like one person who's a real life person had a particular clothing on. And it's like, and that just served as this cue. And I don't know if I ever did any direct work to try and deal with it, but now it almost seems silly to describe it. Oh yeah. Well, dreams are usually silly to describe. Yeah, it was pretty silly, but it was a pretty violent dream. Yeah.

So that sound is now this new thing that it should be associated with safety. And that might be enough, maybe, I hope, to knock you out of that repeated nightmare and maybe even start you on the path to recovery because if you can calm down about those nightmare states of sleep then maybe your locus surrealis which is involved in stress can also relax and you can do the erasure parts that need to be done i love it i seem to recall a paper and i'll have to find the reference and and um send it to you we will also put in the show note captions that described a protocol that essentially matches this idea. And I think what they had people do was either cue themselves to a particular smell or tone in wakefulness, then to try and recall a recurring nightmare. Then during the night's sleep, they had the tone playing in the background, which would then cue them to the wakeful state. They're still asleep, mind you, but in the pseudo lucid or lucid state. And then try and change some variable, as you're describing. Some either look the predator in the eyes or do something different.\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Sobel explains the science behind olfaction, our sense of smell, and chemosensation, our response to chemicals in the environment. They explore the surprising abilities of human olfaction, such as how we process chemical information from others to determine stress levels, hormone states, and even how tears can affect our hormone levels. The conversation covers the phenomenon of nasal cycling, which reflects the dynamic of our nervous system and impacts alertness. Dr. Sobel's work reveals that we are constantly sensing our own odors and subconsciously smelling ourselves to change cognition and behavior. Additionally, the discussion touches on the nasal cycle's connection to the autonomic nervous system and its potential as a non-invasive marker for conditions like ADHD. Finally, Dr. Sobel shares insights into the subconscious ways humans use smell for social interactions, such as identifying individuals and forming\nShow Guest: Dr. Noam Sobel\nTranscript: And it turns out that this is linked to balance in the autonomic nervous system. So as you and your listeners know, we have an autonomic nervous system that has a sympathetic and parasympathetic component to it. And they're in balance or imbalance in many diseases, for example. And this interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system drives the switch from left to right nostril. Yeah. Just to remind people, sympathetic nervous system has nothing to do with sympathy, has everything to do with generating patterns of alertness. It's sometimes called the fight or flight system, but any pattern of arousal, positive or negative, and then it's balanced in a coordinated way, or at least in parallel with the parasympathetic nervous system, which is sometimes called the rest and digest system, but is associated with all sorts of things, the sexual arousal response, and a number of other aspects of our physiology. So think of it like a seesaw of alertness and calm. Yeah? Perfect. So now imagine, right? Imagine you would walk around living your life, right?\n------------------------\n",

This is super important if you're thinking about tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower. If for instance, you love cold showers and ice baths, well, then it's very unlikely that taking cold showers or getting into an ice bath is going to increase your level of tenacity and willpower further. It might reinforce the tenacity and willpower that you've already built, but it's not going to increase it further. You need to add something or subtract something that makes it harder, not easier to engage in or resist a behavior. Okay, I want to be really clear about this.\n------------------------\n",

So the big takeaway is that if you want to increase your tenacity and willpower, you absolutely can. You can do that by triggering activation of this incredible hub within the brain, the anterior mid-singulate cortex, for which there is now a very large amount of evidence, is at least central to the whole process of generating tenacity and willpower, the I absolutely will do that, and the no, I absolutely won't do that. It's the resistance hub. It's the thing that's allocating resources to do the thing that we don't want to do or that someone's trying to prevent us from doing.

Dr. Tye's current work investigates social homeostasis, the idea that we have a set point for the amount of social interaction we need, which can vary based on whether we're introverted or extroverted. She has discovered neurons that are active when we feel lonely, suggesting a biological basis for the sensation of loneliness. Her team also explores social hierarchies, the impact of social media, and how these factors affect mental health.

It is not conducive to being able to actually conjure an alternative perspective in which you construct a meaningful narrative with alternate ethical implications, with alternate prospective possible future outcomes, with alternate views of the historical precedent or context, being able to sort of mentally time travel into the space of those ideas is only really possible when people feel safe to think together. So it sounds like it's anti-creative. Yes. Creativity is also associated with the activations of these networks. Yeah. Causally so in some recent work. I had the good fortune of having dinner last year with somebody. I won't reveal who it is, but he runs a major social media platform. And he told me that in Japan, it's common for people to have two or three or even as many as seven different social media handles. And that they do this in order to embody different versions of themselves safely. So these are not troll accounts.

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 103, Andrew Huberman discusses the neural mechanisms and processes that underlie creativity. He explains that creativity is not just an abstract concept but is rooted in specific neural circuits that can be activated in a particular sequence to foster creative thinking. Huberman emphasizes that everyone has the capacity for creativity as it stems from a subset of neural structures in the brain. He outlines that creativity involves both divergent thinking, which is generating a wide range of ideas from a single starting point, and convergent thinking, which is narrowing down those ideas to find the most useful and novel ones.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in creativity, highlighting two key pathways: the nigrostriatal pathway, which is associated with divergent thinking and movement, and the mesocortical pathway, which is associated with convergent thinking, motivation, and emotion. He suggests that open monitoring meditations can help enhance divergent thinking by allowing for the free flow of thoughts without judgment,\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: The first neural circuit involved in creativity is the so-called executive network. This is kind of a goofy name because the neural circuits that I'm about to describe do a bunch of other things as well, but they certainly control what are called executive functions. Executive functions are functions that you and I both have, which is our ability to govern our thinking and our behavior in very deliberate ways. And that is largely accomplished through the use of the neural circuitry that sits right behind the forebrain, the so-called prefrontal cortex. Now the prefrontal cortex involves many different sub-regions. It has a bunch of different parts, just like any country has different states, et cetera, and provinces. Executive function involves the prefrontal cortex and some other neural structures. But for sake of this discussion, executive function and the prefrontal cortex are mainly responsible for suppressing action. That is for eliminating choices among the infinite number of choices that exist.\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Mackey, a leading expert in pain medicine, clarifies the difference between nociception, the neural processes of encoding and processing noxious stimuli, and the subjective experience of pain. The conversation delves into the critical distinction between physical and emotional pain and how the brain's perception of pain can be influenced by psychological states like anxiety and depression.\n\nDr. Huberman and Dr. Mackey explore the role of the nervous system in chronic pain and discuss behavioral, psychological, nutritional, and pharmacological strategies for pain management. They touch upon the relationship between temperature and pain relief, as well as the controversial use of opioids in clinical settings. The episode also addresses the importance of understanding the distinction between hurt and harm, and how cognitive approaches such as attentional distraction and cognitive reframing can be effective in managing pain.\n\n\nShow Guest: Dr. Sean Mackey\nTranscript: And yes, the medications we have now, you know, we touched base on a few earlier, but we have over 200 medications available for pain. Very few of them FDA approved. We tend to steal from all the other fields. So you're talking about more than 200 medications that can be, yes, prescribed for pain, but as off-label treatments? Perfectly stated, yeah. There's only a few medications that are actually FDA-approved specifically for pain. So what we do is we borrow or steal from the psychiatrists some of their antidepressants, which will frequently work very effectively for pain, and work on those pain-related circuits in the brain. We take from the neurologist some of the anti-seizure medications because those medications, while reducing separately seizures, for people who don't have seizures, they work on ion channels. They work on other neuromodulators that also are involved in pain circuitry. We can take from the cardiologists medications that work on the heart, antiarrhythmia or heart rhythm drugs. They are potent sodium channel blockers. And the sodium channels, as you know, are responsible for the action potential that generates the nerve impulse signal.\n------------------------\n"

And then the other thing to do is I think when we are, when we're facing challenges, when we're going through a hard time, we do have an instinct to want to vent, right? And again, in this era of vulnerability and whatnot, we're told like, yes, share everything that's on your mind. It can actually be counterproductive to vent. And the reason for that is that when you're venting about a hard situation that you're going through or something that you're frustrated about with yourself, typically the person you've invited into the conversation, they're a nice, empathetic person. They want to make you feel better.\n------------------------\n",

            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab Podcast episode with Andrew Huberman discusses the science behind mental training and visualization techniques and their impact on learning and performance across various domains. The podcast emphasizes that mental training and visualization, when done correctly, can significantly improve the acquisition and retention of skills, be it cognitive tasks, musical abilities, or motor skills in sports. Huberman highlights the importance of neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to adapt and change through experience, as the underlying mechanism that supports the benefits of mental training.\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of mental training and visualization, it must be structured in brief, specific, and repeated sessions that mirror the actual physical or cognitive tasks being trained. While mental training is not a replacement for physical practice, it serves as a powerful complement that can enhance learning when combined with actual experience. The podcast also explores individual differences in visualization capabilities and provides insights into how people with conditions like autism or synesthesia might experience mental imagery and visualization differently. Finally, Huberman outlines practical strategies for incorporating\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So the point here is that it's not as if there is zero utility to third person mental training and visualization. There can be, but first person mental training and visualization is going to be more effective as I mentioned before. And if you're going to use a third person mental training visualization, ideally you would be looking at yourself either on video or listening to yourself in audio and or video. That is going to be more effective than closing your eyes and trying to imagine yourself from a third person perspective in your mind's eye. Okay, so just to make it really simple, first person better than third person visualization. If you're going to go with third person visualization, try and go with real third person visualization where you're actually seeing and or hearing yourself on a screen. And again, this was somewhat of a surprise to me. I always thought that mental training and visualization was done with eyes closed. I thought, okay, close your eyes. You imagine this, you imagine that. That's actually not the case for many, many studies, some of which are considered real hallmark studies within the field of mental training and visualization and the different neural circuits that it recruits.\n------------------------\n"

They emphasize that while hydration and whole food nutrition lay the foundation for good health, there are circumstances where supplementation can be beneficial. Dr. Galpin highlights that supplements can be consumed in high concentrations not typically found in nature, which can have significant effects on performance and recovery. However, he cautions against over-supplementation, as it can be unproductive or even harmful. He advocates for precision supplementation based on individual biological testing to provide only what is necessary for each person. Dr. Huberman and Dr. Galpin also discuss creatine as a top supplement due to its wide-ranging benefits for muscle performance, cognitive function, and potential impacts on bone density and neurological health. They stress the importance of consistent supplementation over time to raise baseline functioning and improve resilience. The conversation includes a detailed look at hydration strategies and the potential consequences of both dehydration and overhydration.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: And so because caffeine acts as an adenosine antagonist effectively, while caffeine is present in those receptors, you don't feel as sleepy. You have more energy. Your reaction time goes down. Memory is enhanced, focus, performance of all kinds. Yes, but then when that caffeine is dislodged from the receptor, then the adenosine can act even more potently at those receptors. So it's sort of like being able to borrow against the normal variations in wakefulness and sleep. And this is why we encourage people, if they're not training first thing in the morning, to push their caffeine intake out about 90 to 120 minutes after waking so they can clear some of that adenosine in the morning, which tends to happen even after we wake up. People can listen to episodes on Master Your Sleep or Perfect Sleep or the caffeine episode to understand more about that. But the final thing I just want to say here, and then it prompts a question, is in thinking about supplement protocols, I think a lot of people assume that once they start taking something, they're going to have to take it all the time.\n------------------------\n",

He explains that memory is not just about learning, but also about placing life events into context, linking immediate experiences with past and future ones. Huberman promises to make the science accessible and discusses specific protocols grounded in extensive research that can enhance learning and memory. The episode also touches on unlearning and forgetting, providing tools to reduce the emotional weight of negative experiences. Additionally, he covers topics like deja vu, photographic memory, and how to use the visual system to improve memory. Huberman emphasizes that these insights are based on a solid understanding of brain systems and are separate from his roles at Stanford, aligning with his mission to distribute zero-cost consumer information about science.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, caffeine in the form of coffee or yerba mate or any other form of caffeine does create a sense of alertness in our brain and body. And it does that through two major mechanisms. The first mechanism is by blocking the effects of adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body the longer that we are awake. And it's largely what's responsible for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue when we've been awake for a very long time. Caffeine essentially acts to block the effects of adenosine. It's a competing agonist, not to get technical, but it binds to the receptor for adenosine for some period of time and prevents adenosine from having its normal pattern of action and thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue. But it also increases state of alertness. So while it's reducing fatigue, it's also pushing on neurochemical systems in order to directly increase our alertness. And it does that in large part by increasing the transmission of epinephrine, adrenaline, in the brain and body.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How to Stop Headaches Using Science-Based Approaches\" features Dr. Andrew Huberman discussing various types of headaches, including migraines, tension headaches, and cluster headaches, and their underlying biology. He emphasizes that understanding the specific type of headache and its biological basis is key to selecting effective treatments. Huberman explores both pharmaceutical and natural remedies, emphasizing that many natural treatments can be as effective, if not more so, than drugs, without the side effects. He also debunks the misconception that natural treatments are not scientifically grounded, explaining that they are based on a solid understanding of headache mechanisms. The episode also covers the role of muscular tension, vasodilation, meningeal irritation, and neural and inflammatory responses in causing headaches. Huberman provides insights into how the nervous system processes pain, the importance of distinguishing between different types of headaches, and the potential treatments for each.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Well, one of the main ways in which caffeine makes us more alert is that it occupies the receptors for something called adenosine. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body more and more the longer we've been awake. It's one of the things that makes us feel sleepy. So when we drink caffeine, that caffeine occupies the adenosine receptor and the adenosine cannot have its normal effect of making us sleepy. When that caffeine wears off, the adenosine can bind and we feel sleepy. Adenosine is a vasodilator. So when we drink caffeine, because it blocks the effects of adenosine, there is a vasoconstriction associated with drinking caffeine. So if you have a headache that is associated with excessive vasodilation and pressure in the head, indeed drinking some caffeine can cause some vasoconstriction by preventing that adenosine pathway that would normally lead to vasoconstriction, and you can get some relief from that headache. However, caffeine is also a vasodilator.\n------------------------\n"

Caffeine is a widely used stimulant that not only increases alertness and reduces fatigue but also acts as a powerful reinforcer, meaning it increases our liking for the foods, drinks, and even contexts associated with its consumption. Huberman delves into the positive health benefits of caffeine, which include neuroprotective, antidepressive, and performance-enhancing effects. However, he also addresses the importance of mindful caffeine consumption, as its reinforcing properties can lead to strong preferences that may not always align with healthy choices.\n\nAdditionally, Huberman explores a molecule called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide one), which is associated with reduced hunger and increased satiety through its action in the brain and gut.

First of all, you offset that afternoon crash, and this is an effect that many people experience the very first time they start delaying their caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after waking. And the reason this works so well is the following. As I mentioned earlier, adenosine is a molecule that builds up the longer that we are awake. It is a molecule that is reduced or cleared from our system by sleep. So when we emerge from sleep, regardless of how long we've slept, our adenosine levels are lower than they were when we went to sleep the previous night. If you slept well enough and long enough, those adenosine levels can be very, very low, but they are never completely zero.\n------------------------\n",

He emphasizes that sleep is vital for mental and physical health, performance, immune function, and overall well-being. He provides practical advice on how to shift sleep schedules for work or travel, fall back asleep if waking at night, and recover from poor sleep. Huberman explains that light exposure, temperature, food intake, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital tools are key levers for sleep optimization. He outlines a 24-hour cycle with critical periods for leveraging these tools, highlighting the importance of morning sunlight to set the body's clock, regulating light and temperature in the evening to prepare for sleep, and managing caffeine and food timing. Supplements like magnesium threonate, apigenin, theanine, glycine, GABA, and inositol are discussed for their sleep benefits. Digital tools like non-sleep deep rest scripts and self-hypnosis are also\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Again, caffeine is a denosine antagonist or effectively works as a adenosine antagonist and limits sleepiness. I highly recommend that everybody delay their caffeine intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking. However painful it may be to eventually arrive at that 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you want, and I encourage you to clear out whatever residual adenosine is circulating in your system in that first 90 to 120 minutes of the day, get that sunlight exposure, get some movement to wake up and then, and only then start to ingest caffeine, because what you'll do if you delay caffeine intake until 90 to 120 minutes after waking is you will avoid this so-called afternoon crash. And you may still get a little bit of dip in energy in the afternoon, but it's not going to be that massive crash. I've talked about the reasons for that crash on previous episodes, but if you delay your caffeine intake 90 to 120 minutes after waking, you are doing yourself a great service towards wakefulness and to avoid the crash.\n------------------------\n",

The answer to that is very simple. Many people wake up in the morning, they drink caffeine within 10, 20, 30, sometimes within two minutes of waking, and they feel more alert naturally. That makes sense because of the effects of caffeine in blocking the effects of adenosine that I talked about earlier and its effects on other neurotransmitter systems. But then what they find is that in the early afternoon, in particular after lunch, they experience a dramatic dip in their overall levels of energy, the so-called afternoon crash. And in most cases, the way they respond to that is to ingest more caffeine, which indeed can increase their levels of mood and alertness. However, as we'll soon talk about, there is a problem with ingesting caffeine in the afternoon if it falls within eight or 10, or dare I even say 12 hours of going to sleep. And that is the caffeine ingested in the afternoon for most everybody, I'd say for 95 plus percent of people, disrupts the architecture and quality of their nighttime sleep.\n------------------------\n"

If you set out those goals, then the specific days that you do each workout isn't as critical, but the specific spacing is. So for instance, you're not going to want to do your high intensity interval training the day after you train your legs, because if you're doing that high intensity interval training correctly, you're going to be taxing your legs and eating into their recovery. And so you want to space them out by two or three days. So I think you'll notice that the point is really to optimize everything on the whole, rather than any one specific aspect of training or adaptation. Now that said, I do realize that some people might be hyper-focused on things like strength and hypertrophy and the aesthetics that come with it.

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 41, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses the effects of fasting and time-restricted eating on various aspects of health, including weight loss, muscle maintenance, organ health, and overall well-being. He explains the concept of intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding, which involves eating during specific periods of a 24-hour cycle. The episode explores how different schedules of eating can impact health in numerous ways, such as influencing fat loss, muscle dynamics, organ function, and even cognitive and mood states. Huberman emphasizes the importance of the timing of food intake, as it is as crucial as what is eaten. He also introduces tools and strategies to help manage eating schedules without being overly strict, including ways to mitigate the negative effects of occasionally deviating from a set fasting schedule. The episode discusses a study on fasting blood glucose as a predictor of mortality, highlighting the differences between human and mouse studies, and stresses the importance of considering the species when interpreting research on diet and health\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, is the increase in blood glucose that occurs from high intensity interval training early in the day, is that detrimental? Not necessarily so. That oftentimes is associated with the shuttling of nutrients to the muscles that have just done a lot of hard work. So it's not that high intensity interval training should not be done early in the day. In fact, for many people, including myself, training early in the day, just for the way that my psychology and biology works is always better for me than training later in the day. And the other important thing to mention is that high intensity interval training done late in the day can be beneficial from the perspective of glucose clearing, lowering blood glucose and helping transition from the fed to the fasted state in preparation for sleep. However, if you're ingesting caffeine or anything to engage in that high intensity interval training in a way that prevents you from getting to sleep, well, then it's going to be detrimental overall.\n------------------------\n",

The episode covers a wide range of protocols including how to structure a fitness regimen and integrate recovery, nutrition, and supplementary measures to augment strength, hypertrophy, endurance, anaerobic capacity, and more. Huberman highlights select protocols he has incorporated into his routine that are fun and time-efficient and encourages listeners to tailor these strategies to their goals without significantly increasing workout duration.\n\nKey components of any fitness program consist of a combination of cardiovascular and resistance training sessions. The episode emphasizes the necessity of including different training types (like zone two cardio, strength sessions, and different cardiovascular workouts) and recovery to make continuous progress.\n\nSpecific tools discussed include \"meshing\" zone two cardio with daily activities, like walking, to hit the recommended 200 minutes per week without additional scheduling.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: It's the kind of thing that you might throw in once every two weeks or once every four weeks as a replacement for your other high intensity interval training. The sugar cane involves selecting some form of exercise that you can do at high intensity safely. That of course will differ between individuals. For some of you, it will be a stationary bike. For others of you, it will be a road bike. For others of you, it will be running. And for others of you, it will be rowing. The exact form of exercise is not important. What is important is that you can generate a lot of intensity. So you're going to be doing some sprint-like work, although not all out sprints, except on the final round. I'll explain where all this is going in a moment. But again, you need to select a movement that you can do without injuring yourself while still performing a movement at high intensity. So for me, that would be running. For you, it might be something else. The sugar cane is pretty straightforward in structure. It involves three rounds after a brief warmup, of course.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the episode featuring Dr. Andy Galpin, the discussion with Dr. Andrew Huberman centers on how to design an effective fitness and exercise program that aligns with individual goals for fitness and sports performance. Dr. Galpin emphasizes the importance of understanding the physiological adaptations behind different training protocols and how to combine them to achieve multiple fitness adaptations simultaneously, such as strength, hypertrophy, and endurance. He advises listeners on structuring their training plans to make consistent progress and offers strategies for those with varying time constraints and equipment access. The conversation also covers the importance of having a specific plan for training and the role of progressive overload in achieving fitness goals. Dr. Galpin suggests that adherence to a structured plan can lead to better results compared to a non-structured approach. He introduces a 10-step approach to designing training programs, which includes assessing goals, identifying obstacles (defenders), and considering life events and time constraints when planning training frequency and duration. The episode also touches on the psychological aspects of goal\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: It is the universal substrate for all of that. And I actually think there's some real gems of information in the study design that you described. So just cue that for maybe a potential collaboration between our laboratories. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's very important, but it does cue up another question relevant to fitness in particular, which is what are your thoughts on intermediate goals? So let's say my goal is to drop two percentages, 2% of body fat from where I am now, a year from now, roll into the next year from now, about 2% lower on body fat, but maintain my lean body mass, or maybe even increase it. Yep. How should I assess progress? You know, because the dopamine system loves a goal that it loves anticipation of a goal, but it responds best to, we sort of re-up, if you will, our dopamine. Anytime we get a signal that we are on the right track to that goal. And that signal could be, okay, I did the workout. I just trust that these workouts are going to give me the result I want.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the episode featuring Dr. Andy Galpin, the discussion focuses on endurance, fat loss, and the science behind various training protocols for achieving specific fitness goals. Dr. Galpin emphasizes that endurance training isn't just for athletes but has benefits for longevity and aesthetics as well. He breaks down endurance into two main factors: fatigue management and fueling. The conversation also debunks the myth that lifting weights is only for muscle gain, highlighting the importance of endurance for overall health.\n\nDr. Galpin introduces the concept of mechanical efficiency, particularly in breathing and posture, as key to improving endurance quickly. Nasal breathing is suggested as a simple technique to enhance breathing mechanics. The episode also explores the idea of \"exercise snacks,\" short bouts of intense exercise like running up stairs, which can improve cardiovascular fitness and metabolic health even in an office setting.\n\nFurthermore, the discussion covers the crossover concept, where different intensities of exercise utilize varying fuel sources (fat vs. carbohydrates), and the misconception that training fasted\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Is that a good protocol for building up anaerobic capacity? Keeping in mind what you said before, which is that specificity or precision, as you've raised it, is important. That is, if I want to train anaerobic capacity for sprinting, I probably should have been sprinting. Cycling, I was on the assault bike and so on. How many of those one minute all out sprints or 30 second all out sprints on the bike could and should one perform per workout and per week? So marching through exercise choice. Yep, let's do it. Order, volume, frequency and progression. Yep. Choice of exercises, train for what you want to improve. Is that right? Not necessarily. So in this particular case, if you have a specific goal, yes, of course, do it. Exercise choice, a couple of things you want to look for. You want to pick something that you feel extremely confident in the movement with. Because you're going to forget your brain very quickly here because you're going to go into our pain cave. So if you're not comfortable running, don't go run here.\n------------------------\n"

And then also make sure that one is using full range of motion and perfect form as it were. Now, of course, that is one tiny slice of the possible rep cadences and ways to approach resistance training. Although I think it's a pretty good one. What are the general parameter sets that one needs to consider? You could imagine lifting, you know, four seconds concentric, pause for one, pause for two, eccentric. I realize there's an infinite number of variations here. But is there a way to use rep cadence, repetition cadence, that is, as a way to work through weak points and to be strong in every position of the movement? Yeah, a lovely question.\n------------------------\n",

So what I will lay out to you is a case for which you should bounce, a case for when you should go fast, a case for when you should be under control. All of these things are different variables we can modify and get different adaptations for it. Is there a way that you could lay out for us optimal repetition cadences for strength specifically versus hypertrophy specifically, just to sort of bookend the conversation and then migrate toward the middle in terms of rep cadences that would satisfy the desire to have a bit of both. We can get pretty close. Yeah. So when you're talking about strength versus hypertrophy, remember strength is movement. Hypertrophy is muscle size. That's the key to your answer here. So when you're trying to get stronger, what you're effectively trying to do is get better at producing a certain amount of force through movement. Now force is mass times acceleration. So what's the mass in the bar multiplied by how well I can accelerate it?\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How to Learn Skills Faster,\" Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist and professor at Stanford, discusses the neuroscience of skill acquisition and how to optimize learning. He emphasizes the importance of errors in the learning process, as they signal the brain to focus attention and open up opportunities for neuroplasticity. Huberman advises maximizing repetitions during practice sessions and allowing the brain to rest afterward to consolidate learning. He also debunks the notion that slow movements are best for beginners, suggesting that they are more beneficial once some proficiency is achieved. Huberman touches on the use of metronomes for advanced learners to increase the pace and number of repetitions. He concludes that the key to faster skill learning is to perform many repetitions, pay attention to errors, and allow for periods of rest post-practice for the brain to process and consolidate the new skills.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: You can use a metronome, and obviously musicians do this, but athletes can do this too. You can use a metronome to set the cadence of your repetitions. Now, for swimmers, there's actually a device I was able to find online. I forget what the brand name was, and that's not what this is about, but that actually goes in the swim cap that can cue you to when you need to perform another stroke. And for runners, there are other metronome type devices that through headphones or through a tone in the room, if you're running indoors or on a treadmill, will cue you to when you basically you need to lift your heels. And if you do that, what athletes find is they can perform more repetitions, they can generate more output, you can increase speed. A number of really interesting things are being done with auditory metronoming. And then I'm involved in a little bit of work now that hopefully I'll be able to report back to you about using stroboscopic metronoming.

They wanna keep not only six feet away, but stay at home and never touch you. That loss of basic humanity is the opposite of what I feel in jujitsu, where it was like that contact where you're like, I don't give a shit about whatever rules we're supposed to have in society where you're not, you have to keep a distance and all that kind of stuff. Just the hug, like the intimacy of a hug that's like a good bear hug and you're like just controlling another person. And also there is some kind of love communicated through just trying to break each other's arms. I don't exactly understand why violence is such a close neighbor to love, but it is?

And it's just bred more self-awareness in me. And so I would encourage people to actually seek out connections in uncomfortable spaces because that will allow you to fill in at least some of the gaps. Now, some of the gaps will truly only be revealed to you because of life experiences. So I'm thinking in my own life. So I thought I grieved in a very particular kind of way. And then during COVID, my husband and I experienced multiple pregnancy losses with our surrogate. And I found myself grieving in a way that was completely foreign to me. I don't think talking to anyone would have revealed to me that I was going to grieve in this way where usually I would reach out to people and I would want to stay connected.

Huberman discusses the mechanisms of olfaction (smell), the different types of odors, and how certain smells can modulate our biology, including hormone levels. He also explains how the act of sniffing can enhance cognition and outlines practical sniffing exercises to improve one's sense of smell and taste. The episode further covers the potential sixth taste sense for fat, and the relationship between the tongue, digestion, and the gut-brain axis. Huberman emphasizes the importance of these senses for survival, such as detecting energy sources or avoiding toxins, and how they can be trained and maintained for better health and brain function.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: There's also a lot of interest right now in loss of sense of smell because one of the early detection signs of COVID-19 was a loss of sense of smell. So I just briefly want to talk about loss of sense of smell and regaining sense of smell and taste, because these have powerful implications for overall health, and in fact, can indicate something about brain damage and can even inform how quickly we might be recovering from something like a concussion. So our olfactory neurons, these neurons in our nose that detect odors are really unique among other brain neurons because they get replenished throughout life. They don't just regenerate, but they get replenished. So regeneration is when something is damaged and it regrows. These neurons are constantly turning over throughout our lifespan. They're constantly being replenished. They're dying off and they're being replaced by new ones. This is an amazing aspect of our brain that's basically unique to these neurons. There's one other region of the brain where there's a little bit of this maybe, but these olfactory neurons, about every three or four weeks, they die.\n------------------------\n"

The episode delves into the biological mechanisms of stretching, including the role of motor neurons, sensory neurons, and connective tissue. Huberman explains the different types of stretching\u2014dynamic, ballistic, and static\u2014and their effects on sports performance and pain tolerance. He emphasizes that static stretching, held for around 30 seconds, is most effective for long-term flexibility gains and should be performed consistently. The discussion also touches on the role of the brain's insula and van Economo neurons in modulating the body's response to stretching and pain. Huberman offers practical advice on how to improve flexibility using science-supported stretching protocols, suggesting that stretching for at least five minutes per week, distributed over multiple days, can enhance range of motion.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: We haven't talked about that yet. In general, to avoid injury, it's a good idea to raise your core body temperature a bit before doing these kinds of stretches, even these static stretches, which we can sort of ease into and don't involve ballistic movement by definition. And the basic takeaway that I was able to find was that if we are already warm from running or from weight training or from some other activity, that doing the static stretching practice at the end of that weight training or cardiovascular or other physical session would allow us to go immediately into the stretching session because we're already warm, so to speak. Otherwise, raising one's core body temperature by a bit by doing five to seven, maybe even 10 minutes of easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements, provided you can do those without getting injured, seems to be an ideal way to warm up the body for stretching. We should be warm or warm up to stretch, although those warmups don't have to be extremely extensive.

The episode delves into the biological mechanisms of stretching, including the role of motor neurons, sensory neurons, and connective tissue. Huberman explains the different types of stretching\u2014dynamic, ballistic, and static\u2014and their effects on sports performance and pain tolerance. He emphasizes that static stretching, held for around 30 seconds, is most effective for long-term flexibility gains and should be performed consistently. The discussion also touches on the role of the brain's insula and van Economo neurons in modulating the body's response to stretching and pain. Huberman offers practical advice on how to improve flexibility using science-supported stretching protocols, suggesting that stretching for at least five minutes per week, distributed over multiple days, can enhance range of motion.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: In fact, and unfortunately we don't have time to go into this in too much detail today, I was able to find a number of papers that make the argument that static stretching prior to cardiovascular training, and maybe even prior to resistance training, can limit our performance in running and resistance training. I realize that's a controversial area. You have those who say, no, it's immensely beneficial. You have those who say, no, it inhibits performance. And those that say, no, it's a matter of how exactly you perform that static stretching and which muscle groups and how you're doing this and how much time in between static stretching and performance. But to leave all that aside, doing static stretching after some other form of exercise, and if not after some form of exercise, after a brief warmup to raise your core body temperature, definitely seems like the right way to go. Now, for some of you out there, and I confess for me as well, doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment, even if that commitment is one to only do three sets of 30 second static stretches. I say this because you've got the warmup.\n------------------------\n",

So I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat, I'm certainly not saying that dynamic and ballistic stretching are not useful. They absolutely are. But in terms of increasing limb range of motion in the longterm of truly becoming more flexible as opposed to transiently more flexible, static stretching, which includes PNF, appears to be the best route to go. So if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion for a given muscle group, or perhaps for all muscle groups, although you can imagine that'd be pretty tough. I mean, you're not going to spend time, I could imagine, working on your tongue muscle control or neck muscle control and every muscle control, but most of us want to reduce so-called tightness, in air quotes, and increase limb range of motion for certain muscle groups.\n------------------------\n"

But before I go into that, I just want to say that when we talk about the barriers to epigenetic inheritance, or the barriers to inheritance of acquired traits, in addition to the separation of the soma from the germline that we discussed, the other main barrier, it's called epigenetic reprogramming, which is that we acquired our cells, the genetic material in our cells acquires all kinds of changes, these chemical changes, modifications we discussed. But these modifications are largely erased in the transition between generations. So in the germline, in the sperm and the egg, and also in the early embryo, most of the modifications are removed so we can start a blank slate based on the genetic instructions. And this is crucial.

For those who aren't as familiar with thinking about genes and gene structure and epigenetics, could we think of these, you mentioned the four nucleotide bases, T, G, A, and D, but could we imagine that through things like methylation, it's sort of like taking the primary colors and changing one of them a little bit, changing the hue just slightly, which then opens up an enormous number of new options of color integration. Absolutely. It's just more combinations, more ways, more information. There are the modifications of the DNA, and also there are the modifications of the proteins which condense the DNA that are called histones. So they are also modified by many different chemicals. Again, methylation is a very common modification, acetylation, even serotonin, the serotoninylation of histones. Serotonin. Right. This is a new paper from Nature from a few years ago.

And then you have in every cell of your body two copies, if you're a human, of every chromosome. So every gene is represented twice. These are called alleles, the different versions of the genes. And the thought is that once you enter the next generation, the two copies that you inherited are equal. It doesn't matter whether you acquire them from your mother or from your father, right? There are some situations where it does matter. There is a limited number of genes that are called imprinted genes where it does matter whether you inherit it from your mother or your father. And this is happening through epigenetic inheritance, not because of changes to the DNA sequence, but because of maintenance of these chemical modifications across generations. And as I recall from the beautiful work of Catherine Duloc at Harvard, that especially in the brain, there is evidence that some cells contain the complete genome from mom or the complete genome from dad.

So for example, people tell me, I'm growing horses for many years, and I just know that this horse has a particular character. It's very different from the other horse. And so this is epigenetic inheritance. No, it could be just genetically determined. Yes, this horse inherited a different set of genetic instructions, so it is different. It doesn't have to be about epigenetics. Epigenetic inheritance means that the environment of the parents somehow changed the children. And there are these two main barriers that are serious bottlenecks that we have to think what type of molecule and how they can be bridged. So one possibility is that it's really this limited number of chemical modifications that survive, which is about 10% or so. That could be very interesting. Not a small number. Not a small number, but perhaps. Perhaps. Okay? This is one possibility. The other possibility is that there are other mechanisms.

So when we say about epigenetic inheritance through the paternal lineage, through the fathers, we talk about two generations. And when you go through the mother, it's three generations to talk about when you need to invoke some real epigenetic mechanism. And there, the evidence becomes much more scarce in men. There are examples, more or less convincing. The field is evolving and improving a lot. So for example, now, many people use, the cutting edge is to use IVF in vitro fertilization or transfer of embryos to make sure that you actually, it's the heritable information and not the environment and that it goes through the germline. So this is something that is being done now. There are studies. You're talking about the three-parent IVF where they take the DNA from mom, the sperm from dad, and they take the DNA from mom and put it into a novel cytoplasm?\n------------------------\n"

He also discusses recent research, including a study on the benefits of darkness at night for mental health.

I wouldn't suggest doing it one for every year. I wouldn't suggest a folder one for every 10 years. I think a three to five year increment seemed like a more reasonable and tractable way to go about this. So that's one of the sorts of tools that Dr. Conti referred to as to how to build up one's self-concept, which directly relates to things such as our confidence, our ability to track our own behavior, understand some of our motivations, both conscious and unconscious. But of course, that practice is mainly a conscious exercise. It's really not tapping directly into the unconscious in any kind of direct way as far as we know. Now we can contrast that with the tools and protocols that are designed to tap into the unconscious mind. And of course, there are a number of different ways to do this that were discussed in that four episode series with Dr. Conti. But one of the most powerful ways to do this is by thinking about, and indeed sometimes writing about, or even analyzing one's dreams.\n------------------------\n",

Dopamine is not only linked to pleasure but is also a key driver in our pursuit of goals and the effort we invest. By understanding dopamine dynamics, including peaks, troughs, and baseline levels, individuals can learn to manage their motivation more effectively. Huberman discusses the neurobiological circuitry behind dopamine's influence on our actions and offers practical tools to leverage dopamine for sustained motivation and goal achievement. The episode emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between dopamine, reward, and effort to optimize mental and physical health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And we are going to cover tools that will allow you to leverage your dopamine in order to have maximum motivation to overcome sticking points, which include things like procrastination, but also by understanding the neural circuits in the brain and body that release and use dopamine, but more importantly, by understanding what are called dopamine dynamics. That is what gives rise to big peaks in dopamine or troughs in dopamine, or what's referred to as our baseline level of dopamine, which turns out to be our baseline levels of motivation and feelings of wellbeing. By understanding how those things relate to one another, I assure you that by the end of today's episode, you will be in a far better position to understand why you become amotivated, why you procrastinate, how to ensure motivation on an ongoing basis, and even how to leverage effort and the desire to become motivated as a way to do just that, to become more motivated. Today's discussion is not about psychology, although I will center around practical everyday examples and offer many, many tools that you can implement if you choose. Today's discussion is really about pulling apart these things that we call motivation, reward, pleasure, procrastination, and understanding them in terms of their dopamine dynamics.\n------------------------\n",

I don't know, I don't want to do it or I'm not feeling motivated. Well, then there's a very potent set of tools that you can leverage to overcome states of lack of motivation, overcome procrastination, and indeed can help you deal with things like overthinking as it relates to procrastination and lack of motivation as well. So the way this works is the following. If you recall, a peak in dopamine is followed by a trough in dopamine. That trough in dopamine is experienced as pain or wanting or craving. That pain that I'm referring to is actually a craving or a wanting, and it's a craving or wanting for a specific state that you would like to achieve that is different than the one that you're in. You want to get out of that trough. And as you recall from earlier in the episode, that trough is the stimulus for the ongoing release of dopamine that provides the propeller, the motivation to go forward and seek some goal, okay?\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: The Huberman Lab Podcast episode on \"The Science of MDMA & Its Therapeutic Uses: Benefits & Risks\" explores the chemical properties, neurobiological effects, and potential therapeutic applications of MDMA, particularly for treating PTSD. MDMA, distinct from other psychedelics and stimulants, acts as an empathogen, increasing both dopamine and serotonin, which enhances social connectivity and empathy. Clinical trials have shown promising results for MDMA-assisted therapy in PTSD treatment, with changes in brain function and connectivity correlating with symptom relief. However, MDMA remains a Schedule I drug and is illegal to possess or sell in the U.S. The episode also discusses MDMA's history, its path to potential legality, and the differences between recreational and therapeutic use. Lastly, it addresses concerns about MDMA's neurotoxicity, exploring how therapeutic use may avoid toxicity, and the ongoing debate about its long-term effects.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: If you want to learn about mesolimbic reward pathways and dopamine and how they control everything from your level of motivation to your tendency to procrastinate or overcome procrastination, I've done two episodes about dopamine. You can simply go to hubermanlab.com, put dopamine into the search function, and you'll find at least two episodes on that topic. And you'll also find a number of different tools related to how one can better regulate their own patterns of dopamine release for sake of motivation, et cetera. So MDMA is increasing dopamine to increase reward to a particular experience. What's the experience? Well, this paper beautifully parses the fact that it is serotonin release within a structure called the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the reward pathway, which is rewarding the experience of social interaction. Now they do this by putting mice in arenas where they have the option of either spending time with other mice or not spending time with other mice and blocking the activation of certain brain areas. And again, using drug antagonists, et cetera.\n------------------------\n"

He emphasizes the importance of selecting specific, challenging goals and outlines a 12-week plan to work towards them. Dr. Huberman advises against multitasking goals and suggests focusing on one primary goal at a time. He also dispels myths about goal setting, such as the effectiveness of visual reminders and announcing goals for accountability. The episode highlights the neuroscience behind goal pursuit, including the role of the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Dr. Huberman provides practical tools for initiating and sustaining motivation, such as visual target training, which involves focusing on a point to increase alertness and motivation. He also recommends removing distractions, like turning off phones during goal pursuit sessions, and understanding how to manipulate dopamine levels to maintain motivation.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balchettis\nTranscript: There's a lot there to be understood and incorporated because it has to do with various things, not just in the realm of goal pursuit, but also feelings of wellbeing, staving off depression, things of that sort. The dopamine system is linked to oh so many important aspects of life, far too many than we could discuss right now. And we have those previous episodes in which we do discuss all of that material. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that dopamine is the molecule of motivation and to some extent reward, but really motivation.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode #90 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the effects of nicotine on the brain and body, its addictive nature due to its impact on brain chemicals, and strategies for quitting smoking or vaping. Nicotine, commonly consumed through smoking, has both detrimental health effects and, in specific non-smoking modalities, potential benefits for cognitive function. Huberman explains how nicotine increases dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which can enhance focus, alertness, and mood. However, smoking and vaping, particularly among young people, are on the rise and carry significant health risks due to the damage they cause to the body's endothelial cells and the presence of carcinogens. The episode also covers the challenges of quitting smoking due to nicotine's reinforcement through the dopamine system and offers insights into using nicotine replacement therapies effectively.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: If people are getting so much more dopamine so much more quickly from vaping, shouldn't they be feeling better? That brings us back to the critical, and I should say defining feature of the dopamine reward pathway for motivation and wellbeing, which is that initially a given substance will cause, let's say an eight out of 10, again, arbitrary units, but eight out of 10 increase in dopamine. But with repeated use, what ends up happening is that even at similar or higher levels of ingestion, so not just one inhalation a minute, but maybe two inhalations a minute or inhalation every 30 seconds, now it's level four out of 10 activation of dopamine, and then three, and then two, and eventually it drops below baseline. Now the whole system can be recovered by abstinence from nicotine consumption, but the dopamine system is applied to everything, all sense of wellbeing, all sense of motivation. So during the period in which one is abstaining from nicotine and vaping in particular, people do not feel good. They feel miserable. That's why it's called withdrawal.\n------------------------\n"

They explore a comprehensive range of topics related to male hormone health across all ages, including the impact of hormones on mood, libido, wellbeing, strength, cognition, and psychological factors. Dr. Gillett provides specific recommendations for hormone optimization tailored to different goals and life stages, discussing how to assess whether hormone levels are optimized and how often to test for them. They delve into the importance of behavioral foundations for optimal hormone function and the necessity of avoiding certain activities that could negatively affect hormone levels. They also address the timing of puberty and its implications for adult health, the influence of diet and exercise on hormone levels, and the significance of managing stress and maintaining social connections. The conversation covers the potential use of supplements and prescription drugs for hormone optimization, with an emphasis on doing so under medical supervision. Dr. Huberman emphasizes that the information provided is part of\nShow Guest: Dr. Kyle Gillett\nTranscript: I think of ghrelin as making me hungry. Hungry and angry. Why would I want to take something that would increase ghrelin signaling? Some people are trying to gain weight. It also does increase your growth hormone. So if your growth hormone is very low, you can consider it. Ibutamorin is a long acting, so it has a long half-life, also known as MK-677. It was studied mostly in growth hormone deficiency. And do these people get angry also? They can. Many people report a side effect of anxiety or significant hunger. Most people take it in the evening, so they don't notice that hunger as much. It can also greatly increase your blood glucose. So if you're insulin resistant or pre-diabetic, it gets especially concerning. This is one of those rare moments where I hear something and I think, okay, even though there's this kit of compounds that can increase GH and IGF-1, based on everything you're telling me, maybe just taking GH is the better option for those people because growth hormone, at least it's synthetic growth hormone is mimicking an endogenous hormone.\n------------------------\n",

He clarifies the confusion around the naming of peptides, which are often referred to by acronyms and numbers, and provides an organizational framework to understand their therapeutic uses, advantages, and risks. Huberman explains that peptides are small proteins that can have pleiotropic effects, meaning they can affect many aspects of cells and organ systems. He emphasizes the importance of using peptides prescribed by physicians, as opposed to those from gray or black markets, due to potential safety and efficacy concerns. The episode delves into specific peptides, including BPC-157 and thymosin beta-4, for tissue repair, and discusses peptides that influence growth hormone release, such as sermorelin and tesamorelin, highlighting their benefits\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So again, you want to avoid food in the hour and a half, probably two hours before taking them, and certainly in the half hour or longer after, which is why most people take them right before going to sleep and add or augment that big growth hormone pulse that occurs in the early part of the night. And then many people have perhaps heard of what's called MK-677, which is simply an oral version, a non-injectable, but oral version of these GHRPs. And it tends to have the same issues that the other GHRPs have, which are elevated cortisol, and in some cases, elevated prolactin as well. Okay, so if we just kind of zoom out from all this, we can say that yes, indeed, there are synthetic peptides that can potently increase growth hormone in IGF-1. I explained the rationale for why people would want that, or perhaps to explore that. I'm certainly not suggesting anyone do this. Again, I am suggesting that if you do explore it, you work with a board-certified physician and that you get these compounds from a quality compounding pharmacy or by their name brand prescription.\n------------------------\n",

Nowadays, there's a lot of excitement about continuous glucose monitors, and Levels allows you to assess how what you eat and what combinations of foods you eat and exercise and sleep and things like alcohol, should you indulge in alcohol and things of that sort, how those impact your blood glucose. Now, it's very important that the cells of your body, and in particular, the cells of your nervous system, not experience levels of blood glucose that are too high or too low, so-called hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. What levels allows its users to do is to understand how their specific routines, food intake patterns, exercise, et cetera, impact their blood sugar levels. I, like most people who use Levels, find that there's a lot to learn and a lot to be gained by understanding these blood glucose patterns.

He explores how certain foods can enhance focus, overall brain health, and cognitive longevity. He delves into the subconscious signals from the gut that influence food choices, explaining that neurons in the gut send signals about nutrient content to the brain. Metabolic accessibility of food to the brain and belief about the health benefits of food also play roles in dietary preferences. Huberman emphasizes that one can change their diet to crave healthier foods through understanding these mechanisms. He also revisits the topic of time-restricted feeding, highlighting the importance of consistent eating windows for benefits like weight management and improved sleep and cognition. The episode also touches on the roles of various nutrients in brain health, including omega-3 fatty acids, phosphatidylserine, and choline, and how they contribute to neuron function and integrity. Huberman shares his personal supplementation routine and discusses the importance of consuming\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: The studies of offsetting cognitive decline using alpha-GPC did use quite high dosages of 600 to 900 or even 1200 milligrams per day. So it has been used at those much higher concentrations, but because fortunately, at least not yet or not to my awareness, I'm not suffering from any cognitive decline, I will supplement with 300 milligrams every now and again. Next on my list of compounds that have been shown in peer-review reviewed research to improve neuronal and brain function is creatine. Creatine can be derived from meat sources. It can also be supplemented. Some of you are probably familiar with creatine or have heard about creatine from the context of the health and fitness world where creatine is used to bring more water into muscles, which can enhance the strength of those muscles, as well as bring water into other tissues. So it doesn't just draw more water into muscle, it can draw more water into the body generally. Creatine has also been shown to have an important role in brain function. And once again, this is something that came up during the discussion about depression a few episodes back, creatine can actually be used as a fuel source in the brain.\n------------------------\n",

He emphasizes that focus and the ability to ignore distractions are two distinct abilities, and both can be enhanced through various interventions. Huberman cautions against self-diagnosing ADHD, as many people may experience symptoms without meeting the full clinical criteria. He explores the genetic components of ADHD, its independence from intelligence, and the tendency for people with ADHD to have hyperfocus on subjects of intense interest.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in attention and motivation, its impact on specific brain circuits, and the \"low dopamine hypothesis\" of ADHD. He also discusses the use of stimulant medications like Ritalin and Adderall, which are chemically similar to street drugs but can be beneficial for ADHD when used responsibly under medical supervision.\n\nDietary interventions, particularly the reduction of simple sugars and the implementation of an oligoantigenic\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: One such compound is so-called alpha-GPC, which is a form of choline and increases acetylcholine transmission. Dosages as high as 1200 milligrams per day, which is a very high dosage spread out, typically it's 300 or 400 milligrams spread out throughout the day, have been shown to offset some of the effects of age-related cognitive decline, improve cognitive functioning. People that don't have age-related cognitive decline, that's a very high dose. Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study or to enhance learning of any kind, they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligrams. That's more typical. Again, you have to check with your doctor. You have to decide if the safety margins are appropriate for you. Obviously, you'll want to check that out, but alpha-GPC is effective in creating more focus by way of this cholinergic system. It stimulates acetylcholine release from both of those locations, the PPN in the back of the brain and nucleus basalis in the front of the brain.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How to Learn Skills Faster,\" Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist and professor at Stanford, discusses the neuroscience of skill acquisition and how to optimize learning. He emphasizes the importance of errors in the learning process, as they signal the brain to focus attention and open up opportunities for neuroplasticity. Huberman advises maximizing repetitions during practice sessions and allowing the brain to rest afterward to consolidate learning. He also debunks the notion that slow movements are best for beginners, suggesting that they are more beneficial once some proficiency is achieved. Huberman touches on the use of metronomes for advanced learners to increase the pace and number of repetitions. He concludes that the key to faster skill learning is to perform many repetitions, pay attention to errors, and allow for periods of rest post-practice for the brain to process and consolidate the new skills.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Alpha-GPC, alpha-glycerophosphocholine. See, if I keep doing it over and over, repetitions, alpha-glycerophosphocholine. There, I made an error. Okay, so the point is that alpha-GPC, which is, at least in the United States, is sold over the counter, typically is taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams. That's a single dose or have been shown to do a number of things that for some of you might be beneficial. One is to enhance power output. So if you're engaging in something like shot put throwing or resistance training or sprinting or something where you have to generate a lot of power, maybe you're doing rock climbing, but you're working on a particular aspect of your rock climbing that involves generating a lot of force, a lot of power, well then in theory, alpha-GPC could be beneficial to you. For the cognitive effects, the dosages are much higher, up to 1200 milligrams daily divided into three doses of 400 milligrams is what the studies that I was able to find show or used. The effects on cognitive decline are described as notable.\n------------------------\n"

The Hadza are one example. There are many different foraging populations, but the vast majority of these populations consume huge amounts of dietary fiber because plants are the reliable, consistent source. If you, as a hunter-gatherer, go on a hunt, usually that hunt is unsuccessful. I think the data are that one out of 20 to 30 hunts are successful in landing actually big game for the Hadza. They have birds that they shoot and small animals, but quite often, day after day, they're relying upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. They're relying on the plants in their environment. And actually, if you go to the data and look at what their food preferences are, their food preferences are actually meat and honey.

They eat less meat, animal-based protein, less animal-based fats as a product of this. You know, I will back to Christopher's rule for a healthy diet, a lot of the macronutrient changes that we saw in their diet were consistent with healthy changes in diet, less saturated fat, less animal-based protein, more plant-based protein. So a lot of changes that are known to be beneficial kind of came in concert with just telling people eat a high fiber diet, high plant-based fiber diet. The people that were eating the high fermented food diet, they were instructed to basically eat foods that you could buy at a grocery store that were naturally fermented and contain live microbes.

It's how our brain is wired. And protein and fat are essential for brain development as far as we know, right? So it sounds like the Hadza, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, you said would prefer to eat meat and honey, but they happen to consume a lot of plant fiber as a consequence of what's available. One of the questions I have as it relates to all of this is it sounds to me like there is no question from the pure vegan all the way to the extreme opposite, which would be pure meat diet, that avoiding processed foods is a good idea or heavily processed foods in general. And I mean, not that the occasional consumption is necessarily bad, but whether or not one is thinking about one macronutrient profile or another, it sounds like consuming processed foods is just bad for the microbiome. Can we say that categorically?\n------------------------\n"

And in that case, I recommend taking the carbon dioxide tolerance test over again. And almost always what you'll find is that you have been able to extend your carbon dioxide discard rate. And therefore you now fall into a different category, not just the lower medium, but the long carbon dioxide discard rate category. And you are able to extend the duration of those inhale hold, exhale holds during the box breathing.

So inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Sounds very easy, right? How long do you inhale and then hold, exhale and then hold? Well, you now know. If you were in the low group of carbon dioxide discard rate, your inhale is going to be three seconds, your hold will be three seconds, your exhale will be three seconds, and then you repeat three seconds. So each size of the box, if you will, is going to be three seconds long. If you were in the moderate carbon dioxide discard rate category, then you're going to inhale for five to six seconds, hold for five to six, exhale for five to six, hold for five to six, repeat for about two minutes. You could do three minutes if you want, but I think it's important to have protocols that are feasible for most people.

            "\nShow Summary: In the podcast episode with Dr. Sara Gottfried, the conversation centers on optimizing female hormone health for vitality and longevity. Dr. Gottfried, an obstetrician-gynecologist and expert in hormone health, discusses the importance of managing the gut microbiome, nutrition, and exercise for maintaining healthy hormone levels. She emphasizes the unique needs of women regarding their gut microbiome and its influence on estrogen, testosterone, thyroid, and growth hormone. The discussion also covers the importance of omega-3 fatty acids and the right balance of resistance and cardiovascular training for women. Dr. Gottfried highlights the prevalence of digestive issues in women and the tools available for overcoming them to improve hormone health. She advocates for specific types of tests, including blood, urine, and microbiome tests, for women to understand their hormone status and trajectory. The conversation also touches on navigating different life stages, from puberty to menopause, and the role of hormone replacement therapy. Dr. Gottfried's expertise extends to intergenerational factors\nShow Guest: Dr. Sara Gottfried\nTranscript: Another group did box breathing, inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations. The duration of each of those inhales and holds was set by their carbon dioxide tolerance. So somewhere between three and eight seconds, depending on how well they regulate to carbon dioxide. Another group did cyclic sighing. So this would be double inhale through the nose. So big inhale through the nose, followed by a two lungs empty exhale. That second inhale after the first big long inhale through the nose is really important because it makes sure that all the collapsed alveoli, the lungs snap open. And then the exhale, you offload a lot of carbon dioxide. That's very similar to holotropic breathwork. Yes, not unlike holotropic breathwork, little bit pranayama-ish, but the exhale is rather passive as opposed to active. And then the fourth category was cyclic hyperventilation, which is a lot like TUMO, aka Wim Hof-ish breathing, different than Wim Hof breathing. So this would be, so very active inhales and exhales.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode titled \"How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid & Growth Hormone,\" Andrew Huberman delves into the roles of thyroid hormone and growth hormone in regulating metabolism. He explains that these hormones are essential throughout life for the development and maintenance of the body and brain. Huberman emphasizes that thyroid hormone, which needs iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine to be produced, is crucial for converting energy from fats and sugars, and for promoting growth and repair in various tissues. He also discusses how growth hormone, which can be increased through proper sleep and exercise, is vital for tissue repair and maintaining a healthy body composition. Huberman provides actionable tools for modulating these hormones, including dietary adjustments and specific types of exercise. He also addresses the importance of maintaining proper levels of these hormones for cognitive function and overall health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So the takeaway here is that heat seems to have positive effects on growth hormone, big effects. It seems to have positive effects on reducing cortisol levels, and it does not seem to have effects on things like testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin directly. You can imagine that a shift in any hormone is going to alter the levels of other hormones down the line, sort of indirect effects. But in terms of direct effects, just during or immediately after the sauna bath, there were no effects. So we've talked about diet, supplementation, behavioral tools, and of course, we talked about the underlying biology and logic, and hopefully you heard the safety precautions for all of those. Now I'd like to just briefly talk about the prescription side of all this. There are, as we know, many people taking growth hormone because it's been prescribed to them by a doctor. And presumably there are people taking growth hormone, even though it has not been prescribed by a doctor, which is none of my business. But the point here is that most all of the hormones that we make have been synthesized. So there are versions of them in little bottles or little ampules that people can inject.\n------------------------\n",

He explores the science behind how heating from both external and internal sources impacts our biology, and how it can be harnessed through tools like saunas and local heat application. The episode delves into a study published in the journal Cell, which shows that local heating can convert white fat into metabolically active beige fat, potentially aiding in fat loss. Huberman also discusses how understanding the biology of burns has led to new methods to combat obesity and metabolic disorders. Throughout the episode, he emphasizes the importance of the proper application of heat for health benefits and cautions against the risks of overheating.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: But before I do that, I want to review some of the data and one study in particular that discovered certain forms of deliberate heat exposure using sauna can stimulate very large increases in growth hormone output, which for people in their thirties, forties and beyond could be very useful and may also be useful for people who are just trying to stimulate the release of more growth hormone in order to, for instance, recover from exercise or stimulate fat loss or muscle growth or repair of a particular injury. The title of this paper is Endocrine Effects of Repeated Sauna Bathing. And this is a paper that was published in 1986, which is some years ago, but nonetheless serves as a basis for a lot of other studies that followed. So let me describe what they did in this study. They used an 80 degree Celsius environment. So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit. And they had subjects do this sauna for 30 minutes, four times per day. So that's two hours total in one day, 30 minutes in the sauna, a period of cool down rest, 30 minutes in the sauna again, cool down rest, a third and a fourth time.\n------------------------\n",

Along the lines of temperature and hormones, I just want to mention a very recent study just came out, March, April, 2021, endocrine effects of repeated hot thermal stress and cold water immersion in young adult men. Unfortunately, it was just in men. They didn't look at women, but nonetheless, I think the data are relevant to everybody as a general theme. This is Podstrowski et al. I will put a link to the study in the caption. And they looked at testosterone, prolactin, cortisol, et cetera. And what they found was that the sauna does indeed lead to a significant decrease in cortisol, a stress hormone, a hormone that you want to be released early in the day when you wake up, but sauna definitely led to a significant decrease in cortisol, but did not change testosterone, DHEA, or prolactin levels. So that's interesting. And it turns out that the cold did affect some of these hormones, but the results there were a little bit more mixed.\n------------------------\n"

Nicotine, commonly consumed through smoking, has both detrimental health effects and, in specific non-smoking modalities, potential benefits for cognitive function. Huberman explains how nicotine increases dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which can enhance focus, alertness, and mood. However, smoking and vaping, particularly among young people, are on the rise and carry significant health risks due to the damage they cause to the body's endothelial cells and the presence of carcinogens. The episode also covers the challenges of quitting smoking due to nicotine's reinforcement through the dopamine system and offers insights into using nicotine replacement therapies effectively.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: David Spiegel is 23% of people who do this hypnosis one time succeed in quitting smoking. Now in the old days, which actually wasn't that long ago, before the advent of smartphones and before the internet took off to the extent that it has now, this was done by having someone come into the clinic and Dr. Spiegel himself or one of his colleagues would take somebody through the hypnosis. Nowadays, you can access this hypnosis. There's a wonderful app that was developed by Dr. David Spiegel and others. It's called Reveri, R-E-V-E-R-I. I've talked about this app a few times on the podcast before because there are hypnosis scripts within the app for enhancing sleep, for improving ability of fall asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night, for focus and a number of other behavioral and emotional changes.

            "\nShow Summary: The podcast episode from the Huberman Lab discussed the importance of oral health, not just for the appearance and health of teeth and breath, but for overall bodily health, including brain and cardiovascular health. Andrew Huberman introduces oral health as the seventh pillar of mental health, physical health, and performance, emphasizing the impact of the oral microbiome on various bodily systems. He explains that oral health protocols can reverse early cavities and strengthen teeth through the process of remineralization, primarily influenced by saliva's pH level. Huberman discusses the importance of saliva and its role in oral and gut health, and offers insights into daily protocols for maintaining oral health, including zero-cost practices. He highlights the need for proper oral care routines, such as brushing and flossing, especially at night when saliva production decreases, to prevent cavities and promote overall health. The episode also touches on the implications of diet, hydration, and avoiding certain behaviors like mouth breathing, which can negatively affect oral health.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals.

            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Supercharge Exercise Performance & Recovery with Cooling\" episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses the science of how cooling certain areas of the body can dramatically improve exercise performance and recovery. He explains that cooling the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet, and the face \u2013 areas with special vasculature called arteriovenous anastomoses (AVAs) \u2013 can more effectively regulate core body temperature than cooling other parts of the body. This method of cooling can enhance endurance and strength significantly and is used by professional athletes and the military. Huberman emphasizes that cooling the entire body, such as with ice baths, is less efficient and could impede muscle recovery and growth. He also touches on the effects of substances like caffeine on body temperature and exercise performance, advising that caffeine should be used before, not after, workouts for those who are adapted to it.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And I think that's really where InsideTracker sets itself apart from other similar tests. What InsideTracker offers is, first of all, they make the tests very easy. They can come to your home to take your blood and DNA test, or you can go to a testing center nearby you. Then you get the information back. And rather than just getting information about whether or not the levels of various things are high or low, you also get to find out what to do about it. So it offers directives related to nutrition, to exercise and so forth. It really allow you to be in control of your overall health, both where you are now and its long-term trajectory. With InsideTracker, they also have something which is, it can give you a readout of your inner age. They have something called the inner age test that really compares your biological age to your chronological age, something that's of extreme importance and interest because it has to do with lifespan or predicted lifespan.

The episode delves into the biological mechanisms of stretching, including the role of motor neurons, sensory neurons, and connective tissue. Huberman explains the different types of stretching\u2014dynamic, ballistic, and static\u2014and their effects on sports performance and pain tolerance. He emphasizes that static stretching, held for around 30 seconds, is most effective for long-term flexibility gains and should be performed consistently. The discussion also touches on the role of the brain's insula and van Economo neurons in modulating the body's response to stretching and pain. Huberman offers practical advice on how to improve flexibility using science-supported stretching protocols, suggesting that stretching for at least five minutes per week, distributed over multiple days, can enhance range of motion.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So it appears that the greatest improvements in limb range of motion for your time spent and effort spent is going to be this minimum of five minutes per week to elicit a significant response with five days being the minimum weekly recommended frequency to achieve significant range of motion improvements. I confess this was pretty surprising to me when I compare flexibility training to say resistance training for strength and hypertrophy. I've had the experience and I know that other people have had the experience and I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree that provided one trains hard enough and appropriately that you don't need to train resistance training five days a week in order to get significant improvements in strength and hypertrophy. Some people might need to, but you can get a lot of positive results in those variables with less frequent training, certainly with three or four days a week of training. And for cardiovascular training, I'm not aware of anyone having tested whether or not one very long run each week can actually increase cardiovascular fitness and you're not doing anything else. Although I have to imagine you'd probably see some improvement compared to not doing anything. But most people are doing repeated training sessions of cardiovascular strength training.\n------------------------\n",

Now, of course, there will be a ton of lifestyle factors. If you're a regular practitioner of yoga, if you have a dedicated stretching practice, if you're doing other things to improve your muscle contractibility, so you're doing resistance training, it turns out can actually indirectly improve flexibility. There are a number of different factors, but the key point is that maintaining some degree of flexibility and maybe even enhancing range of motion and flexibility is of immense benefit for offsetting injury, provided it's not pushed too far. There are a number of people who have pushed their limb range of motion so far that they experience all sorts of injuries, both acute and chronic injuries. Today, we'll also talk about how to avoid those scenarios. Okay, so we've established that there are mechanisms within the spinal cord, muscles, and connective tissue.\n------------------------\n",

The results clearly show that, quote, the change in flexibility appeared to be dependent on the duration and frequency of stretching. This is great. This tells us that stretching for a given amount of time scales with the amount of limb range of motion improvement that one will see. There were many interesting findings within this study, but the one that I'd like to highlight most is, quote, the results of this study suggest that a 30-second duration is an effective amount of time to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch in order to increase range of motion. No increase in flexibility occurred when the duration of stretching was increased from 30 seconds to 60 seconds, or when the frequency of stretching was increased from one to three times per day. Okay, so now we're starting to lay down some parameters. What this study reveals and what subsequent studies tell us, and we will get into those subsequent studies, is that ideally one would do static stretches that are held for 30 seconds, perhaps more in certain instances, and I'll explain when that can be useful, but here holding those stretches for more than 30 seconds did not turn out to be additionally useful.\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Galpin highlights the importance of strength and hypertrophy training for everyone, not just athletes, as it combats neuromuscular aging and preserves muscle function. He clarifies that strength training is essential for maintaining muscle power and strength, which is crucial for everyday movements and preventing falls as we age. The conversation also touches on the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training for cognitive function, immune health, and overall longevity. Dr. Galpin dispels misconceptions about strength training, emphasizing that it can be started at any age and is not solely for building muscle mass, but also for maintaining functional abilities. He also discusses the neuromuscular adaptations that occur with strength training, such as improved nerve firing, muscle contractility, and changes in muscle fiber type.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Intentionally going slower is only reducing acceleration right so it's hard to argue that going slower is going to improve strength because you're simply reducing acceleration so you need to practice lifting heavier at a faster rate now does that mean if you're trying to get, there are no phases of your training in which you'll slow down or pause? No, of course not. There are certain rules in different organizations where you have to pause the bottom. Like there's all kinds of little things like that. But in general, we want to think about what are we trying to do here? We're trying to get better at moving a heavier mass at a faster rate of acceleration. That is more force. That is more strength. Hypertrophy is not that. The goal here is not a functional outcome. It is what is needed to cause the most amount of hypertrophy. And when you get to hypertrophy then, your optimal cadence is up to you. You can do any combination. In fact, you could do it the same exact cadence that you did your strength training with and get the same adaptations as hypertrophy if you modify the other variables appropriately. Or you could go slower.\n------------------------\n",

Huberman outlines his workout schedule, emphasizing training large muscle groups like legs and adjusting for recovery and biomechanical safety with activities such as heat-cold contrast sessions for recovery.\n\nThe podcast also explores the benefits of long endurance workouts, the importance of resistance training coupled with tailored sets and repetitions for hypertrophy or strength gains, and the significance of incorporating neck exercises for overall stability and safety. Huberman reinforces the necessity of balancing fitness types throughout the week, providing a foundation for full-body health.\n\nAdditionally, he announces the launch of the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel, offering in-depth responses to listener questions and exclusive content.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: It sounds so simple, three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing. So this could be while you're in the shower or when you arrive at your car, you might sit in your car quietly and do that if you have time, or maybe even while you're driving back to or onto your next destination, just to really slow down your breathing, to really look at the recovery period that has to follow each training session. And of course, during which the adaptations, the changes that make you more fit than you were going into the exercise occur. And that three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing has been shown in Andy's group and in related experiments, not exactly the same, but related experiments in our laboratory and in other laboratories to really so-called downshift the nervous system and really set you up for maximal recovery, rapid recovery, and allow you to lean into the next training session with full intensity when that training session eventually arrives. So it's a very simple tool, but a very potent tool for your overall fitness. So thank you for joining me for this discussion of what I'm calling a foundational, or I guess we could even get bold and call it an optimal fitness protocol. Although the word optimal is a tricky one.\n------------------------\n",

So because that everything driving power and strength is quality based, you want to do these at the beginning of your workout. You would not want to do anything fatiguing before this. So no cardiovascular training, no other repetition to failure stuff. If you do those before and now you're slower, all you've done is practice getting slower. And so these need to be done when you're fresh. You also need to do them when you're very fresh because they are the most neurologically demanding. They're complicated. They tend to have multiple steps and they're often in multiple planes and coordination is a difficult thing. And if you're trying to do all that at maximum speed, your nervous system needs to be tremendously fresh. And so any amount of fatigue here is only going to compromise results. To kind of recap that, one of the major mistakes when training for strength, and especially power, is people worry way too much about fatigue. Those things should not be part of the equation. In fact, if they are, that's a very good sign you're not doing this correctly. These are non-fatiguing movements, especially speed and power.\n------------------------\n"
