An example of a practice mentioned is the deliberate increase of adrenaline every other day or as frequently as possible, while learning to stay calm in the mind. This deliberate induction of adrenaline while maintaining mental calmness is aimed at building the capacity to regulate adrenaline and cortisol, which can be beneficial in dealing with unwanted events and pushing back on potential infection from bacteria or viruses.\n\nThe utility of deliberately increasing adrenaline while staying calm mentally in dealing with unwanted events lies in its ability to provide great utility when adrenaline is induced unexpectedly through unforeseen events or situations. By practicing this deliberate dissociation of mental calmness from the heightened bodily state, individuals can learn to regulate their actions even when experiencing high levels of adrenaline. This approach can help individuals to maintain a sense of control and composure during stressful or challenging circumstances, allowing for more effective responses to unwanted events.

            "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"Using Cortisol & Adrenaline to Boost Our Energy & Immune System Function,\" Andrew Huberman discusses the importance of cortisol and adrenaline in regulating energy levels and immune system function. He emphasizes the benefits of optimizing cortisol release through morning sunlight exposure and leveraging short-term stress to boost immunity and learning. The podcast covers strategies for increasing energy and immune response, such as cold exposure, intense exercise, and specific breathing techniques. Huberman also explores the negative effects of chronic stress on health, including disrupted sleep and increased anxiety, and discusses the biological mechanisms behind cravings for comfort foods during stress. He provides actionable advice on how to regulate stress hormones and improve overall well-being.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: I should just remind you that most of the negative effects on your life and on the lives of others are due to people, perhaps you, I hope not, being unable to regulate their mind when they have high levels of adrenaline in their body, either because they read something in a text or a comment section. Of course, that never happens to me, but it may happen to you. Of course, it happens to me. But the idea is to stay calm in your mind so that then you can regulate your action, right? And so I think that there are these practices that one can develop over time that are really straightforward and zero cost, right? You could find any number of ways to increase your adrenaline and stay calm. And we tend to focus on things like exercise as the way that we get our energy up. But today, again, I'm talking about deliberately increasing adrenaline while staying calm mentally, because that has great utility when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events, through things that we didn't seek out. So the ability to regulate adrenaline and cortisol is about inducing them deliberately when you want to push back on infection, potential infection from bacteria or viruses.\n------------------------\n",

So they're going to bias you towards more stress in other domains. Remember, cortisol can cross the blood brain barrier. So you're going to be more prone to psychological stress. I also want to mention again again that I think there's great benefit to having a practice that perhaps you do every other day, but if you can't, maybe every third day or every other day of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body while learning to stay calm in the mind so that you learn to separate the brain body experience. You know, we hear so much about how beneficial it is to unify the brain and body that we're all out of touch with our brain and bodies. I particularly dislike claims like that or statements like that, because there's great power as we learned today in having your body activated by some sort of stimulus, cold water, or even psychological stress, but learning to stay calm in your mind.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the episode \"Tools for Managing Stress & Anxiety,\" Andrew Huberman delves into the science behind stress and emotions, exploring how to understand, manage, and leverage stress for health benefits. He explains the biology of stress, debunking myths and highlighting its role in aligning our internal state with external experiences. Huberman discusses the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, their functions, and how they can be harnessed through breathing techniques like the physiological sigh to regulate stress responses in real-time.\n\nHe also addresses the positive aspects of acute stress, such as its capacity to enhance focus and immune function, and introduces breathing exercises that can induce a beneficial stress response to combat infection. Huberman emphasizes the importance of managing medium-term stress by increasing our stress threshold through practices that dissociate the mind's calmness from the body's heightened state.\n\nFor long-term stress, he underscores the significance of social connection and its relationship with neuromodulators like serotonin, which can foster feelings of well-being\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: A lot of stress inoculation, a lot of managing medium term stress on the timescale of weeks, or maybe even a couple months. So we're not talking about years of stress. A lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold. It's about capacity. And there are very simple tools, excellent tools that will allow us to modulate our capacity for stress. And they look a lot like the tools I just described. They involve placing oneself deliberately into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat, not to the extreme, and then when we feel flooded with adrenaline, and normally we would panic, it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally, calming ourselves and being comfortable with that response in our body. So unlike trying to unify the mind and body and make it all calm or make it all alert, this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way. And what would this look like? Well, this is something I actually do as a practice because I mentioned before, you can use physiological size in real time. You can use the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection if you're feeling kind of run down.\n------------------------\n"

In particular, they can be sedative. Many of them can be habit forming or even addictive. And for many people, not all, but many people, they don't want to take drugs, whether or not they're over the counter or prescription drugs or even more natural supplement based type treatments. And they would rather use, for instance, a behavioral approach in which they can modulate, they can deliberately turn off the communication between sensory neurons and motor neurons. And it turns out those approaches exist as well. Okay, so at this point, I promise you that I'm not going to give you any more of a biology lesson in terms of pain sensing and headaches as a more conceptual phenomenon. Instead, what I'd like to do next is talk about the different types of headaches. And I think this is something that's very important and not often discussed, except for those people out there that unfortunately suffer repeatedly from certain kinds of headaches like migraine or cluster or tension headache.\n------------------------\n",

Would you want to make it such that you have the headache, but you don't perceive the headache? That is you cut off communication between the sensor and the motor so that the muscles relax. Turns out there are treatments and approaches for each and every one of those. Each and every one of those has different advantages and disadvantages. But as you can quickly see, we are going to have different types of headaches and different approaches to treating headache. But if you keep in the back of your mind that you have neurons that contract muscles to create movement or tension of muscles, remember you can turn off those neurons and allow those muscles to relax. You have sensory neurons that sense input and actually sense the pain. And you have modulatory neurons, which can allow you to adjust the relationship between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. And of course, some of you are probably screaming at me by now saying, wait, why would you ever want to deal with the motor neurons or the modulatory neurons? Wouldn't you want to just go straight to the source and just cut off the pain?\n------------------------\n",

And laboratories, both in the United States, which is Chufu's, and elsewhere are starting to find the underlying mechanisms. And those mechanisms include deactivation of the pain pathways, activation of some of the parallel pathways that assist in shutting down pain or in relaxing the muscles that are causing tension type headache, as well as activation of neural pathways that impinge on organs that then cause or reduce the release of molecules into the body that give us the experience of pain.

Tim Ferriss is an author, a podcaster, an investor, and is known for having a near-supernatural ability to predict the future, which has allowed him to obtain success in a huge number of different endeavors. For instance, he is a five-time number one New York Times bestselling author. But perhaps equally or more important to that, he's also exceptionally good at teaching people how to write, the entire process of writing and marketing a book. His books, The 4-Hour Chef and The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek, not only explain his own exploration of how to optimize and prioritize his time and learn particular skills, but he teaches you those skills as well. This is really what sets Tim apart. He is an exceptional learner and an exceptional teacher.

            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: It turns out that imagining success and visualizing success can be useful at the outset of a goal and maybe every once in a while in pursuit of that goal, but that it's not terrific for putting you in constant pursuit of that goal. Rather, foreshadowing failure, visualizing failure and all the terrible things that it's going to bring seems to be more effective. And that maps very well to what's known about the neural circuitry and the involvement of the amygdala. Focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractors. Removing distractors and getting your body and brain into a mode of activation, getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure that puts you into forward motion towards your goals is absolutely key. So that's a brief summary of what I've covered up until now. There were other things too, of course, the dopamine system and the power of subjective top-down control in regulating that dopamine system. But I want to be sure to include a tool that's been especially powerful for me, that's grounded in the neuroscience research and in the psychology research.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Goals Toolkit: How to Set & Achieve Your Goals\" episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses strategies for setting and achieving personal goals. He emphasizes the importance of selecting specific, challenging goals and outlines a 12-week plan to work towards them. Dr. Huberman advises against multitasking goals and suggests focusing on one primary goal at a time. He also dispels myths about goal setting, such as the effectiveness of visual reminders and announcing goals for accountability. The episode highlights the neuroscience behind goal pursuit, including the role of the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Dr. Huberman provides practical tools for initiating and sustaining motivation, such as visual target training, which involves focusing on a point to increase alertness and motivation. He also recommends removing distractions, like turning off phones during goal pursuit sessions, and understanding how to manipulate dopamine levels to maintain motivation.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balchettis\nTranscript: However, if you arrive to your practice, meaning you show up to the piano to learn piano, or you're sitting down to the table, or maybe you haven't even gotten enough motivation to go toward the piano or toward your notebook or computer or whatever landscape it is that you are going to be pursuing your goal within, and you are having, quote unquote, a hard time getting motivated toward that goal, well, then it turns out, what the scientific literature tells us, is that visualizing the end, keeping the end in mind, positive visualization of all the good things that you'll experience when you achieve that goal is not going to be an effective strategy to motivate you. Rather, if you are not feeling motivated, then what the scientific literature tells us is that you actually want to spend one to three, maybe five minutes visualizing failure, visualizing how terrible you will feel if you do not achieve your goal, visualizing severe consequences, perhaps mostly of the sort like telling yourself, gosh, I set a goal, I set a 12 week block, I quantify it, I know I want to do this, here I have the time to do it and I'm simply just not doing it.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: We talked about some of the neuroscience and psychology and popular understanding of goal seeking behavior, how to assess goals, et cetera. Talked about the beautiful work of Emily Balsettis at New York University and her work on the use of the visual system to better achieve goals. And indeed things like visualization and why forecasting failure can be more effective than forecasting success as counterintuitive as that might seem. That's what the data point to. And we talked about the importance of setting concrete plans and really what that means and what intervals at which to assess progress and what intervals at which to assess reward and how the dopamine system is involved. And in addition, I described this practice that one can incorporate as a daily or semi-daily practice of so-called space-time bridging, of using the visual system and your ability to deliberately step your visual system from stations that are within your body, so-called peripersonal or interoceptive space, out into the world further and further, and then back again in sequence as a way to harness and cultivate and build up these systems that link vision, space, time, reward systems, and so forth.\n------------------------\n"

And the general instruction is to start slow, to start with one or two, and then to find a level that you're comfortable with that doesn't create an excessive feeling of warmth in the stomach, that doesn't throw off your digestion. So it takes a little bit of experimentation. Again, definitely talk to your healthcare provider before exploring this, but this has become a very common practice for people with autoimmune disorders and accessing the gut because it is accessible by taking things has also become way in which people with various mental conditions are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing. Along these lines, I do want to mention that there are studies that show that people that supplement with a lot of probiotics or even prebiotics can sometimes experience brain fog.\n------------------------\n",

Now, hydrochloric acid can burn you, right? Acids can burn you. They literally can melt away skin. You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly. But hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form, in capsule or pill form. And there is a practice of starting to ingest one or two hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal. And then what people will generally do is examine to see whether or not that improves their symptoms of indigestion, how it relates to mood, how it relates to wellbeing, how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera. By changing the acidity, you also change the way that the gut communicates with the brain through the mechanisms we talked about before. And there are a growing number of people embracing these practices of taking HCL. It's often combined with other things.

They explore a comprehensive range of topics related to male hormone health across all ages, including the impact of hormones on mood, libido, wellbeing, strength, cognition, and psychological factors. Dr. Gillett provides specific recommendations for hormone optimization tailored to different goals and life stages, discussing how to assess whether hormone levels are optimized and how often to test for them. They delve into the importance of behavioral foundations for optimal hormone function and the necessity of avoiding certain activities that could negatively affect hormone levels. They also address the timing of puberty and its implications for adult health, the influence of diet and exercise on hormone levels, and the significance of managing stress and maintaining social connections.

Only if their homocysteine is persistently elevated. And homocysteine is kind of like an inflammatory marker that can build up if you're not converting enough of it downstream. How would I know? Just a blood test. Or if you knew your MTHFR polymorphism, which is basically how you add methyl groups to many things in the body. Great. Any side effects of betaine that people should be aware of? Not that I know of. Okay. People can look it up on examine.com is a great site for that. They'll surely list it.

Huberman addresses common questions about the health implications of low to moderate drinking compared to abstinence or heavy consumption. He also discusses strategies to mitigate hangover effects and the genetic differences that influence alcohol metabolism and the risk of developing alcoholism. The episode emphasizes that while alcohol can temporarily alleviate stress and elevate mood, chronic intake\u2014even at low levels\u2014can lead to increased baseline stress, reduced mood, and changes in neural circuits that may encourage further drinking. Huberman clarifies that the podcast provides information without judgment, aiming to empower informed decisions about alcohol consumption.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And we've been talking about some of those effects, effects like reducing the amount of stress. I mean, how many times have we heard somebody say, oh, I need a drink and then they have a drink and they're like, calm down. Now they can shake off the thoughts about the day's work. They can start to think about things in a maybe more grounded or rational way, or at least they believe that, or they can somehow just relax themselves. Well, while that very well may be true, that it can relax them, when they are not drinking, that level of cortisol that's released at baseline has increased substantially. Again, this relates to a defined neural circuit between brain and body, and it has to do with the ratio of cortisol to some of the other hormones involved in the stress response. We'll provide a reference to the study that describes how all of this works for those of you that really want to delve into it. But let's go back to this issue of those who are prone to alcoholism versus those who are not. Remember, there are people who have genetic variants that meaning genes that they inherited their parents, that make it more likely that they will become alcoholics.\n------------------------\n",

Well, those people experience changes in their hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis that result in more cortisol, more of this so-called stress hormone being released at baseline when they are not drinking. This is really important. People who drink a bit, and when I say a bit, I don't mean one or two sips or even a glass of wine every once in a while. I mean, again, people that are maybe having one drink a night with dinner and maybe on the weekend, a few more. Again, I offer a bunch of different patterns to explain how it could also be two or three drinks on Friday or six drinks only on Saturday. Well, all of those groups experience increases in cortisol release from their adrenal glands when they are not drinking.

Likewise with sleep, likewise with any number of different topics you might be interested in. So get enough quality sleep and thereby reduce stress and also directly buffer stress with real-time tools to buffer stress that I've talked about in the episodes that you can access. And there are ways to greatly reduce your overall level of stress to limit any cortisol that's released early in the day, which is when you want cortisol released and not have it late in the day and so on and so forth. So reduce your stress. And as I just told you, by all means, do not drink more than two drinks per week and zero is better than two. If anyone tells you, oh, well, there's, you know, all this resveratrol in red wine and that's good for us, the data simply tell us that there's not enough resveratrol in red wine to really have any positive health benefit.

Dr. Balcetis explains that how we perceive a goal\u2014whether we see it as close or far, easy or difficult\u2014can significantly influence our energy levels and strategy when approaching it. Her research has shown that narrowing our visual focus, as if through a spotlight, can create the illusion that a goal is closer, making it feel more attainable and less daunting. This technique has been found to increase speed and efficiency in physical tasks and reduce the perceived effort required. Dr. Balcetis discusses the importance of not only setting goals but also planning for obstacles and creating actionable steps to overcome them.

And it's worth pointing out that most of the effect of Adderall is an increasing dopamine as opposed to norepinephrine. It does increase norepinephrine, but its major effects, or we should say the major effects that have made it such an attractive drug to so many people, both for the treatment of ADHD and for people to take recreationally or off prescription or for sake of studying or work simply because they want to focus more and longer is because of its ability to increase dopamine to such a great extent.

He debunks the common misconception that an effective gratitude practice merely involves listing things one is thankful for. Instead, he highlights neuroimaging and physiological data that suggest a different approach is necessary. Huberman emphasizes that receiving gratitude can significantly activate neural circuits associated with health benefits. He also explores the concept of \"theory of mind\" and its relation to pro-social behaviors. The episode delves into how narrative stories of gratitude can synchronize physiological responses, such as heart rate, among listeners. Huberman also explains how gratitude practices can reshape neural circuits, reducing anxiety and increasing motivation. Additionally, he touches on neurochemical aspects, specifically serotonin's role in enhancing pro-social behaviors and how certain supplements might influence gratitude practices. Lastly, Huberman suggests a practical gratitude practice framework, including frequency and timing, to harness these benefits.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Taking a substance that increases a neurochemical in your brain will likely, provided it's the right substance and it's the right practice, will likely enhance the amplitude or the intensity of that practice and make it a more potent form of inducing neuroplasticity, meaning it will create longer lasting or more robust brain changes than if one hadn't increased their chemistry in this way, this way of taking something. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you couldn't get to the very same place without it by simply doing a slightly longer gratitude practice or putting a little bit more mental effort into it. That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity really resides in not just one approach, not just neurochemistry and taking substances to increase neuroplasticity, not just behavioral practices to try and increase neuroplasticity, not just brain machine interfaces or devices to increase neuroplasticity, but rather the convergence of multiple tools. So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission, as we say in the brain, using something like KANA combined with a gratitude practice in the not too distant future. This will probably also be combined with some sort of non-invasive device to stimulate the prefrontal cortex at the same time.\n------------------------\n",

MDMA, ecstasy, is a unique compound in that it leads to big increases in brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously. And I realize that the neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin often work in concert, not alone, the way they're commonly described in the more general popular discussions. However, it is a unique compound and it's different than the serotonergic compounds like LSD and psilocybin. And there are now data still emerging that it might be, and in some cases can be useful for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and similar things. Why would that work? And a larger question, perhaps the more important question is psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those compounds, in my mind, there are two components. There's the experience you have while you're on them. And then there's the effect they have after. People are generating variations of these compounds that are non-hallucinatory variations.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 103, Andrew Huberman discusses the neural mechanisms and processes that underlie creativity. He explains that creativity is not just an abstract concept but is rooted in specific neural circuits that can be activated in a particular sequence to foster creative thinking. Huberman emphasizes that everyone has the capacity for creativity as it stems from a subset of neural structures in the brain. He outlines that creativity involves both divergent thinking, which is generating a wide range of ideas from a single starting point, and convergent thinking, which is narrowing down those ideas to find the most useful and novel ones.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in creativity, highlighting two key pathways: the nigrostriatal pathway, which is associated with divergent thinking and movement, and the mesocortical pathway, which is associated with convergent thinking, motivation, and emotion. He suggests that open monitoring meditations can help enhance divergent thinking by allowing for the free flow of thoughts without judgment,\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Now, there are forms of pharmacology that can shift brain neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in ways that favor creativity. And this is certainly a topic that we will go into in more depth in a future episode, but there's an exciting study that was performed just this last year, looking at the role of serotonin, another neuromodulator, in divergent and convergent thinking. And it turns out that serotonin underlies a lot of the brain activity that's responsible for both divergent and for convergent thinking. And there's one particular form of pharmacology, which can enhance activation of the serotonergic pathways associated with the so-called 5-HT, that's serotonin, 5-HT, that's the abbreviation, 5-HT2A receptor, serotonin 2A receptor in particular brain areas in ways that favor both divergent and convergent thinking. And the pharmacologic agent in that case turns out to be very low dose, or as some of you may have heard of it referred to as micro dosing of psilocybin.\n------------------------\n"

Dr. Rechavi explains that while traditional genetic inheritance is well understood, recent evidence suggests that acquired traits and even memories can be passed down through epigenetic mechanisms. This means that experiences can modify our genes in ways that affect our offspring and even multiple generations down the line.\n\nDr. Rechavi provides an accessible overview of genetics, epigenetics, and the mechanisms by which certain experiences can lead to genetic modifications. He emphasizes the importance of RNA in potentially mediating these transgenerational effects. The conversation also touches on the complexities of distinguishing between genetic and environmental influences on traits and the ongoing debates in the scientific community regarding the extent of epigenetic inheritance in humans.\n\nThe episode delves into the significance of model organisms like C. elegans (nematodes) in studying these genetic phenomena. Dr. Rech\nShow Guest: Dr. Oded Rechavi\nTranscript: We later also identify genes that regulate for how long an effect would last. Otherwise, if in the beginning we ask how does it stop after one generation, now we have to ask why doesn't it last forever? And it doesn't. Typically, we see that the responses last not only with the viral resistance, but also with other traits for a few generations, three to five generations. We found genes that function as a sort of a clock that times the duration of the inheritance. What sorts of genes are those? So we call these genes MOTEC genes. MOTEC, I don't know how is your Hebrew, but MOTEC, it means sweetheart in Hebrew. But the acronym is Modified Transgenerational Epigenetic Kinetics. There are different types of genes like that. And for some of them, if you mutate, if you disrupt their function, now the effect would transmit stably for hundreds of generations. It would never stop. Because their role is to stop the inheritance from just, you don't want to carry over something forever, otherwise it will no longer fit the environment of the parents, and you'll be prepared for the wrong things. So this is important.\n------------------------\n",

Dr. Rech\nShow Guest: Dr. Oded Rechavi\nTranscript: What type of genes are they? One gene that we studied it's called metu it's actually a gene that functions in methylation of the of the proteins that condense the dna so this is and there are but when there are other genes that affect also production of smaller ns is there some mechanism that controls the duration of passage in a way that logically links up with the lifespan of the organism? So for instance, I knew my grandparents, met them. I did not ever meet my great grandparents. And I certainly didn't meet my great, great grandparents. I could imagine that my great, great grandparents or my great grandparents experienced certain things that were passed into their children and uh perhaps into their children but it seems reasonable given that humans live somewhere between zero and uh a hundred years typically what now 80 years is that the typical lifespan more or less okay that the if i were going to design the system, and again, I was not consulted at the design phase, I would want an adaptive trait to be passed for two generations.\n------------------------\n",

Dr. Rech\nShow Guest: Dr. Oded Rechavi\nTranscript: In this field of acquiring traits or the passage of information to offspring, what is the proper language to refer to what we're about to discuss? There is this idea, and I'll say it so that you don't have to, that dates back to Lamarck and Lamarckian evolution, very controversial, right? And maybe not even controversial. I think it's very like offensive even to certain people. This idea of inheritance of acquired traits, the idea that one could change themselves through some activity, use the example of going to the gym. We could also use the example of somebody who becomes an endurance runner, then decides to have children within another endurance runner and has in mind the idea that because they did all this running and not just because they were biased towards running in the first place, but because of the distance they actually ran that their offspring somehow would be fabulous runners. Okay, this Lamarckian concept is, we believe, wrong. So how do we talk about inheritance of acquired traits? What's the proper language for us to frame this discussion? Right. We have to be very careful, as you said. And there are many complications and many ambiguities.\n------------------------\n"

And in the case of C. elegans, the response can be very specific through this inheritance of RNAs, which are just sequence specific. They downregulate, they control one particular gene. In other cases, it could be a very general response. And it's very interesting to think about it when we talk about inheritance of memories, which is the most interesting thing we could imagine. Can brain activity of some sort transmit, at least in these worms? I said, Noah, I said this disclaimer multiple times in members we don't know, times will tell. In worms we know a lot. So can worms transmit brain activity to, do they have the specificity to do it? Okay. Before I'll say that, I'll just say that we over the years learned a lot about the mechanisms that shuttle the RNAs between generations. We know about genes that are needed just for that. About worms, it would be perfectly okay, but just don't have the capacity to transfer the RNAs to the next generations. We know about genes that will make the responses longer or shorter.\n------------------------\n"

There are other languages that have very, very few. For example, Hawaiian. Hawaiian has an inventory of about 12 to 14 different phonemes, 14 different consonants and vowels. English, on contrast, has about 40 different consonants and vowels. So languages have different inventories. They can overlap for sure, but different languages use different sound elements, combine and recombine those elements to give rise to different words and meanings. Can we say that there is a most complicated language out there or among the most complicated, would it be Russian? It's definitely high up there. English is up there too, actually. Yeah, German as well. And in terms of learning multiple languages during development, my understanding is that if one wants to become bilingual or trilingual, best to learn those languages simultaneously during development, ideally before age 12, if one hopes to not have an accent in speaking them later. Is that correct? Or do you want to revise that? Well, basically the earlier and the earlier is better, the more intense it is and the more immersive it is.\n------------------------\n",

And one point I want to make about it is this, is that in English, for example, there are about 40 different phonemes. Phonemes are just consonants or vowels or individual speech segments. But these articulatory features that you refer to, for example, the characteristic sounds that are generated by specific movements in the mouth, you can more or less reduce that to about 12 different features. Okay, these are specific movements of the tongue, the jaw, the lips, the larynx. There are about 12 of these movements. And just like you said, Andrew, by themselves, they have no meaning. They're just movements. But what's incredible about it is that you take these 12 movements and you put them in combinations and you start putting them in sequence. We as humans use those 12 set of features to generate all words. And because we can generate nearly an infinite number of words with that code of just 12 features, we have something that generates essentially all possible meaning. Because that's what we do as humans. We generate meanings.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In episode 87 of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Erich Jarvis, a neurobiologist exploring the complexities of vocal learning, speech, and language. Dr. Jarvis's work investigates the genetic and neural underpinnings of how species like humans, songbirds, and parrots acquire and produce language, including the ability to learn and articulate complex vocalizations. They discuss the intricate relationship between speech, language, and movement, such as dance, and how these elements are intertwined both biologically and cognitively. They also delve into the idea that reading engages sub-perceptual motor activity in the throat, reflecting internalized speech. The conversation covers the potential evolutionary pathway from innate vocalizations to learned speech and the concept of critical periods for language acquisition. Dr. Jarvis's research suggests that the brain regions associated with speech production may have evolved from those involved in controlling body movement, leading to the unique human capacity for sophisticated language and even the ability to dance\nShow Guest: Dr. Erich Jarvis\nTranscript: And so you narrow down the ones you use to string the phonemes together in the words that you learn, and you maintain those phonemes as an adult. And here comes along another language that's using those phonemes or in different combinations you're not used to. And therefore, it's like starting from first principles. But if you already have them in multiple languages that you're using, then it makes it easier to use them in another third or fourth language. I see. Incredible. So it's not like your brain has maintained greater plasticity. It's your brain has maintained greater ability to produce different sounds that then allows you to learn another language faster. Got it. Are the hand gestures associated with sounds or with meanings of words? I think the hand gestures are associated with both the sounds and the meaning. When I say sound, like if you are really angry, right, and you are making a loud screaming noise, right, you may make hand gestures that look like you're going to beat the wall, right? Because you're making loud sounds and loud gestures, all right?\n------------------------\n"

What's been shown over and over again in this literature is that performing mental training and visualization repeatedly and in a very restricted way that makes it easier to perform those trials over and over and over again, and with a high degree of accuracy, almost always, really we can fairly say in essentially every study where it's been explored has led to improvements in real world performance of both cognitive and or physical tasks. So if you're trying to learn anything at all, I do encourage you to explore motor training and visualization because basically all the studies out there, in fact, I couldn't find one exception where some degree of improvement wasn't observed when people use motor training and visualization on a consistent basis, even just the three to five times per week, these simple repeats over and over. So I don't want to overcomplicate or make it sound like mental training and visualization has to be performed in a very precise way or that it has to be done perfectly each and every time. Quite to the contrary.\n------------------------\n",

However, when it comes to learning and improving performance in the cognitive or physical domain, they are not equivalent. So this is the second principle of mental training and visualization. As you recall, the first principle of mental training and visualization was that in order to make it effective, it needs to be very brief and very simple and repeated over and over again. The second principle of mental training and visualization is that while yes, mental training and visualization recaptures the same patterns of neural firing in the exact same ways as real world behavior and thinking, it is not as effective as real world behavior and thinking. In other words, if you want to learn something, the ideal situation is to combine real training in the physical world with mental training. And I'll talk about exactly how to do that and in what ratios a little bit later.\n------------------------\n",

And in doing so, we can really stamp down a third principle of mental training and visualization, which is that your mental training and visualization will be far more effective if you are performing the exact same or very similar mental and physical tasks in the real world. Okay, so first principle is mental training and visualization needs to be simple and brief and repeated. Second is that mental training and visualization is not a replacement for real world motor training or cognitive training. It's an augment. It's an addition that can really help. And the third principle of mental training and visualization is that you need to combine mental training and visualization with real world behaviors and experiences that are very, very similar. Now as a brief, but I think really relevant aside, one of the things that also makes mental training and visualization more effective is when we assign cognitive labels to what's going on when we visualize.\n------------------------\n"

Do a task in the real world, do 50 trials of the imagined task, do the trial in the real world again. Significant improvement in speed and accuracy through now what are becoming to be established neural circuit connections between cerebellum and primary motor cortex. Okay, so this study is one of several, but not a tremendous number of studies out there that are starting to really pinpoint the underlying neural circuits that allow mental training and visualization to really improve motor skill performance. But again, and please hear me on this, in this study and in the vast majority of other studies that have shown significant improvement in motor performance in the real world by use of mental training and visualization, there was an ability of each and every one in the study to perform the specific motor sequence in the real world that then they were able to enhance with mental training and visualization. Now, thus far, we've been talking mostly about performance of motor sequences. And one of the things to really understand about performance of motor sequences, both in the real world and in the imagined context is that it involves the doing, that's what we call a go action and not doing certain things.\n------------------------\n",

What's been shown over and over again in this literature is that performing mental training and visualization repeatedly and in a very restricted way that makes it easier to perform those trials over and over and over again, and with a high degree of accuracy, almost always, really we can fairly say in essentially every study where it's been explored has led to improvements in real world performance of both cognitive and or physical tasks. So if you're trying to learn anything at all, I do encourage you to explore motor training and visualization because basically all the studies out there, in fact, I couldn't find one exception where some degree of improvement wasn't observed when people use motor training and visualization on a consistent basis, even just the three to five times per week, these simple repeats over and over. So I don't want to overcomplicate or make it sound like mental training and visualization has to be performed in a very precise way or that it has to be done perfectly each and every time. Quite to the contrary.\n------------------------\n",

I misspoke in the sense that, again, I said, for the thing that you're trying to learn, remember mental training and visualization is going to be most effective for building up the number of accurate trials or your ability to do something with a greater frequency of something that you're already capable of doing or have done at least once in the real world. This is not to say that mental training and visualization can't be used to acquire new skills. It can in principle, but it has been shown to be most effective for enhancing the speed and the accuracy of skills that one has already demonstrated some degree of proficiency at in the real world. I think that's important to point out because we often hear mental training visualization and this equivalence of perceptual and motor experiences in our mind's eye to the real world.

So they are prone to concussions and head injuries simply by virtue of their work without any millions of dollars contracts or the opportunity to necessarily, in some cases they do, but necessarily to do other things. And certainly car accidents or bicycle accidents are not voluntary events. So the point being traumatic brain injury and headache related traumatic brain injury extends far beyond the realm of sports. And in fact, if you were to look at the numbers, what you find is that more than 90% of traumatic brain injury, so people coming into the hospital or clinic or people claiming that they've got consistent headaches, they're not sleeping well, their mood is off, they're feeling more irritable after having hit their head even once, is not the consequence of sports. It's going to be the consequence of accidents either at the workplace or in terms of a bicycle or other sorts of transportation-based accident, like a car accident.\n------------------------\n",

Keeping in mind, of course, that football is this very salient example of traumatic brain injury and concussion as is boxing, as is even soccer with heading of the ball, believe it or not, repeated low level impact to the forehead and other parts of the head can give rise to over time traumatic brain injury without the need for any kind of full-blown concussion or being quote unquote knocked out. But sports related concussion actually occupies just a tiny fraction of the majority of traumatic brain injury and concussion. Most traumatic brain injury and concussion and low level brain injury that can accumulate over time to become traumatic for sake of daily living, that is lowered cognition, disruption in mood, sleep, et cetera, is actually the consequence of things other than sports. So for instance, bicycle accidents, playground accidents, construction accidents, and this is often forgotten.

For some reason, football and hockey and boxing get all the attention. But my colleagues that work on traumatic brain injury tell me that most of the traumatic brain injury they see is somebody slips at a party and hits their head or is in a car accident or environmental accidents of various kinds. To my mind, most helmets don't actually cover this region close to the eyes. So is there also a failure of helmet engineering that, you know, I can understand why you'd want to have your peripheral vision out the sides of your eyes, periphery of your eyes, but it seems to me if this is such critical real estate, why isn't it being better protected? You know, I'm no expert in helmets, but I don't think we see a lot of epidural hematomas in sports injuries. To get this kind of injury, you usually need a really focal blunt trauma, like the baseball bat to the head is a classic mechanism of injury that would lead to a temporal bone fracture and epidural hematoma. With sports injuries, you know, you don't often see that, especially in football with, you know, a sharp, sharper object coming in contact with the head.\n------------------------\n"

The episode covers a wide range of protocols including how to structure a fitness regimen and integrate recovery, nutrition, and supplementary measures to augment strength, hypertrophy, endurance, anaerobic capacity, and more. Huberman highlights select protocols he has incorporated into his routine that are fun and time-efficient and encourages listeners to tailor these strategies to their goals without significantly increasing workout duration.\n\nKey components of any fitness program consist of a combination of cardiovascular and resistance training sessions. The episode emphasizes the necessity of including different training types (like zone two cardio, strength sessions, and different cardiovascular workouts) and recovery to make continuous progress.\n\nSpecific tools discussed include \"meshing\" zone two cardio with daily activities, like walking, to hit the recommended 200 minutes per week without additional scheduling.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: Now, the one exception to this that I incorporated was that for very small muscle groups, so for instance, the rear deltoids, or for neck work, or for calf work, to not rely purely on three to five repetitions, but maybe to work in a range of anywhere from five to eight repetitions. So still fairly low repetitions, but not so low that it restricts you to three to five repetitions. The reason for that is that I, and I think a lot of people out there, find it hard to fatigue those smaller muscle groups adequately with good form when restricting oneself to those low repetitions. However, for big compound movements like presses and squats and deadlifts and glute ham raises and things of that sort, maybe even leg extensions and leg curls, which are isolation exercises, of course, to really restrict oneself to those three to five repetition ranges that take you to failure or near failure. I listed off the benefits of doing that that I experienced, and I'm confident that you will also experience a lot of benefits. So just to remind you what some of those benefits are, you get stronger, which feels great. That occurs within your weight workouts, but it also carries over to your endurance training sessions.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab guest series episode with Dr. Andy Galpin, they discuss the science and methods to increase strength, hypertrophy (muscle growth), and endurance. Dr. Galpin highlights the importance of strength and hypertrophy training for everyone, not just athletes, as it combats neuromuscular aging and preserves muscle function. He clarifies that strength training is essential for maintaining muscle power and strength, which is crucial for everyday movements and preventing falls as we age. The conversation also touches on the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training for cognitive function, immune health, and overall longevity. Dr. Galpin dispels misconceptions about strength training, emphasizing that it can be started at any age and is not solely for building muscle mass, but also for maintaining functional abilities. He also discusses the neuromuscular adaptations that occur with strength training, such as improved nerve firing, muscle contractility, and changes in muscle fiber type.\nShow Guest: Dr. Andy Galpin\nTranscript: But in reality, if it is, you can do whatever you would like. Tell me if this is a reasonable structure, given what you've told us. Three exercises per muscle group. First exercise, slightly heavier loads. So repetition ranges somewhere between, let's say, five and eight, with perhaps hitting failure or close to it on the last set rest periods of somewhere between two or let's, let's get wild and say five minutes. Okay. So it's a little bit more of a strength type workout at that point, but then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets where the repetition ranges now eight to 15, shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so. And then on the third exercise, repetition ranges of 12 to 30. This number 30 kind of makes me wide-eyed when I think about it. I can't remember the last time I did a set of 30 thinking it was for hypertrophy, but what you're saying makes absolute sense and is research-backed. So very short rest intervals, maybe 30 seconds between sets. Would that allow somebody to target all three forms of major adaptation? I mean, in my mind it works.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast #94 titled \"Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health,\" Andrew Huberman discusses science-based tools to optimize physical health, covering various fitness aspects such as endurance, strength, flexibility, hypertrophy, and more. He proposes a general fitness protocol that individuals can adapt to pursue specific fitness goals such as increased strength or endurance. Huberman outlines his workout schedule, emphasizing training large muscle groups like legs and adjusting for recovery and biomechanical safety with activities such as heat-cold contrast sessions for recovery.\n\nThe podcast also explores the benefits of long endurance workouts, the importance of resistance training coupled with tailored sets and repetitions for hypertrophy or strength gains, and the significance of incorporating neck exercises for overall stability and safety. Huberman reinforces the necessity of balancing fitness types throughout the week, providing a foundation for full-body health.\n\nAdditionally, he announces the launch of the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel, offering in-depth responses to listener questions and exclusive content.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So it might be anywhere from three to four sets per exercise. Again, still just two exercises and longer rest between sets, anywhere from two minutes to maybe even four minutes if it's really heavy leg work. And then for the next month, switch to repetition range that's closer to eight to 12, maybe even 15 repetitions per set, but do fewer sets overall. So maybe just two to three sets per exercise, again, just two exercises per muscle group typically. And shorten the rest between sets so that it's more in the 90 second, maybe even as short as 60 seconds rest between sets, but typically 90 seconds to about two minutes or two and a half minutes. So basically it's one month heavier, the next month slightly lighter, although I wouldn't say light, I would say moderate weight and moderate rep range. That tends to work well for me. It also adheres to a principle that came up during the discussion, again, with Dr. Andy Galpin, that for hypertrophy, you really can use repetition ranges anywhere from five to 30, three zero reps. But he emphasized changing the repetition ranges in order to offset boredom.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In episode 83 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Emily Balcetis, a psychology professor at New York University, about the science of motivation, goal setting, and the impact of visualization on achieving success. Dr. Balcetis explains that how we perceive a goal\u2014whether we see it as close or far, easy or difficult\u2014can significantly influence our energy levels and strategy when approaching it. Her research has shown that narrowing our visual focus, as if through a spotlight, can create the illusion that a goal is closer, making it feel more attainable and less daunting. This technique has been found to increase speed and efficiency in physical tasks and reduce the perceived effort required. Dr. Balcetis discusses the importance of not only setting goals but also planning for obstacles and creating actionable steps to overcome them. The conversation highlights the power of vision as a tool for enhancing motivation and the practical applications of this research for everyday goal achievement.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balcetis\nTranscript: But is there a kind of a higher level, kind of a black belt version of what we're talking about here, where not only am I focusing on a specific visual location as an intermediate or a long-term goal, or I'm using an app to ask me a question and tap into how I'm feeling, create a visual representation of my motivational state, but that I'm also making my phone as bright as possible. I'm also trying to take that visual window and actually pay attention to more of the details at that location. Or is it simply a matter of kind of, in geek speak visual neuroscience, we would just call this like low spatial frequency, just sort of grabbing a black and white snapshot of something here or there in my mind. If I attach more detail and effort to the specific thing that I'm focused on, is there any evidence that that's more effective? It certainly, you know, changes what our brains are doing. So, you know, how do we define effectiveness? That's a question for philosophers and that scientists will always- Will it keep me running? Yeah. It will when you use it towards the end of your run, just like you've picked up on. Yeah.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode titled \"The Science of Setting & Achieving Goals,\" Andrew Huberman discusses how neuroscience can inform the process of goal setting and achievement. He explains that goal-oriented behaviors are controlled by a single neural circuit involving the amygdala, basal ganglia, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. This circuit assesses the value of goals and determines the actions necessary to pursue them, with dopamine playing a key role in this process. Huberman critiques the abundance of acronyms and methods in the goal-setting literature, suggesting they often boil down to a few common themes. He also discusses the importance of making errors for learning and optimizing the difficulty of tasks to ensure an 85% success rate for optimal learning. Huberman then debunks common misconceptions about goal pursuit, such as the ineffectiveness of multitasking and the power of visual focus. He also emphasizes the importance of visualizing potential failures rather than just successes to double the likelihood of achieving goals. Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: And so next we're going to talk about what the literature says about things like visualization, immediate and intermediate goals, long-term goals, and how to best achieve those. And then we're going to move specifically into the protocols that you can use. It's a protocol that I've specifically developed for you, the listeners, in order to incorporate all the signs into a best practice that you can do anytime, any place to really identify what it is specifically that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal. Focusing our visual attention on one particular point is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit. And if you'd like to read some of the scientific studies or read a review of the scientific studies that have looked at how narrowing one's visual attention can really enhance the effectiveness of pursuing goals, I'll put a link to this study. The title of the study is Keeping the Goal in Sight, Testing the Influence of Narrowed Visual Attention on Physical Activity. And this is a paper from Emily Balsettis' lab. It focuses mainly on physical activities, but it mentioned some other things as well. This is an article published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin in 2020.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the \"Goals Toolkit: How to Set & Achieve Your Goals\" episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discusses strategies for setting and achieving personal goals. He emphasizes the importance of selecting specific, challenging goals and outlines a 12-week plan to work towards them. Dr. Huberman advises against multitasking goals and suggests focusing on one primary goal at a time. He also dispels myths about goal setting, such as the effectiveness of visual reminders and announcing goals for accountability. The episode highlights the neuroscience behind goal pursuit, including the role of the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Dr. Huberman provides practical tools for initiating and sustaining motivation, such as visual target training, which involves focusing on a point to increase alertness and motivation. He also recommends removing distractions, like turning off phones during goal pursuit sessions, and understanding how to manipulate dopamine levels to maintain motivation.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balchettis\nTranscript: And it allows you to increase your level of focus, your level of motivation, and the sustainability of your focus and motivation while in goal pursuit. So it's a quite valuable protocol to incorporate, and it's something that you can do once for 30 seconds and then lean into whatever it is, your writing process, your running process. It's something that you could do repeatedly throughout that learning bout, and it's something that you can practice offline a little bit away from that training bout as a means to sort of learn and get familiar with so that then you can incorporate it very quickly and repeatedly and with much more effectiveness during these different learning bouts. Again, it's a highly valuable tool that's grounded in neural circuitry, grounded in neurochemistry, and that Emily Balchettis' lab has shown in numerous domains, physical pursuits, cognitive pursuits can really help people achieve their goals and to achieve them more easily, or at least with less perceived effort and more quickly. Now we can get a bit more granular about the incorporation of this tool, this protocol, but before we do, we should acknowledge that all of the things that lend themselves to improved cognitive focus and physical ability still hold true, right?\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In episode 83 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman interviews Dr. Emily Balcetis, a psychology professor at New York University, about the science of motivation, goal setting, and the impact of visualization on achieving success. Dr. Balcetis explains that how we perceive a goal\u2014whether we see it as close or far, easy or difficult\u2014can significantly influence our energy levels and strategy when approaching it. Her research has shown that narrowing our visual focus, as if through a spotlight, can create the illusion that a goal is closer, making it feel more attainable and less daunting. This technique has been found to increase speed and efficiency in physical tasks and reduce the perceived effort required. Dr. Balcetis discusses the importance of not only setting goals but also planning for obstacles and creating actionable steps to overcome them. The conversation highlights the power of vision as a tool for enhancing motivation and the practical applications of this research for everyday goal achievement.\nShow Guest: Dr. Emily Balcetis\nTranscript: But is there a kind of a higher level, kind of a black belt version of what we're talking about here, where not only am I focusing on a specific visual location as an intermediate or a long-term goal, or I'm using an app to ask me a question and tap into how I'm feeling, create a visual representation of my motivational state, but that I'm also making my phone as bright as possible. I'm also trying to take that visual window and actually pay attention to more of the details at that location. Or is it simply a matter of kind of, in geek speak visual neuroscience, we would just call this like low spatial frequency, just sort of grabbing a black and white snapshot of something here or there in my mind. If I attach more detail and effort to the specific thing that I'm focused on, is there any evidence that that's more effective? It certainly, you know, changes what our brains are doing. So, you know, how do we define effectiveness? That's a question for philosophers and that scientists will always- Will it keep me running? Yeah.

            "\nShow Summary: The episode \"How to Focus to Change Your Brain\" from the Huberman Lab podcast, hosted by Andrew Huberman, delves into the science of neuroplasticity\u2014the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience. Huberman explains that neuroplasticity is not just for children; adults can also rewire their brains with the right practices and conditions. He emphasizes the importance of focused attention, alertness, and the use of certain neurochemicals like epinephrine and acetylcholine to facilitate plasticity. Practical advice is given on how to improve focus, including managing sleep, motivation, and practicing visual focus. Huberman also touches on the use of pharmacology, like caffeine or nicotine, to enhance alertness and cholinergic transmission, which can aid in the neuroplasticity process. The episode provides insights into how we can harness our brain's plasticity to learn and adapt at any age, given the right conditions and practices.\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: Spending just 60 to 120 seconds focusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen, meaning just on my screen with nothing on it, but bringing my eyes to that particular location increases not just my visual acuity for that location, but it brings about an increase in activity in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated with gathering information from this location. So put simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus, practice visual focus. Now, if you wear contacts or you wear corrective lenses, that's fine. You of, would want to use those. You don't want to take those off and use a blurry image. The finer the visual image and the more that you can hold your gaze to that visual image, the higher your levels of attention will be. Many times on Instagram, and here I've been teased for not blinking very often. That's actually a practiced thing. We blink more as we get tired, which as you hear it, you'll probably just say, duh. As we get tired, the neurons in the brainstem that are responsible for alertness and that hold the eyelids open start to falter and our eyelids start to close.\n------------------------\n",

Finally\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: So what is special about focusing one's visual attention at a given location? Well, it turns out that we have two branches of our visual system. So visual information all comes in through our eyes, but then it can head down two different pathways. One pathway is engaged when our vision is brought to a common point, what we call a vergence eye movement. So if we're focusing very intensely on a given point, regardless of how far away from us that point is, our visual system engages a certain set of neurons, neural circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail and that can evaluate small changes over small periods of time. Just think of it as a very detailed camera of the visual world. And it tends to be very restricted. The other pathway through the visual system is a so-called Magnocellular pathway. And this is a pathway that's involved in taking in global information about lots of things that are happening around us, movement of things to our right, movement of things to our left, things that are happening down on the ground and all around us. And that pathway involves a sort of relaxation, if you will, of the neural circuits that are associated with alertness and attention.\n------------------------\n"

For years, I had the same recurring nightmare over and over and over again. And it was so salient and so clear. And I'm not going to share what it is because it's not that it's that disturbing. It was just, I think it was the emotional load of it and just how salient certain features were. Like one person who's a real life person had a particular clothing on. And it's like, and that just served as this cue. And I don't know if I ever did any direct work to try and deal with it, but now it almost seems silly to describe it. Oh yeah.

And I think what they had people do was either cue themselves to a particular smell or tone in wakefulness, then to try and recall a recurring nightmare. Then during the night's sleep, they had the tone playing in the background, which would then cue them to the wakeful state. They're still asleep, mind you, but in the pseudo lucid or lucid state.

They explore the surprising abilities of human olfaction, such as how we process chemical information from others to determine stress levels, hormone states, and even how tears can affect our hormone levels. The conversation covers the phenomenon of nasal cycling, which reflects the dynamic of our nervous system and impacts alertness. Dr. Sobel's work reveals that we are constantly sensing our own odors and subconsciously smelling ourselves to change cognition and behavior. Additionally, the discussion touches on the nasal cycle's connection to the autonomic nervous system and its potential as a non-invasive marker for conditions like ADHD. Finally, Dr. Sobel shares insights into the subconscious ways humans use smell for social interactions, such as identifying individuals and forming\nShow Guest: Dr. Noam Sobel\nTranscript: And it turns out that this is linked to balance in the autonomic nervous system. So as you and your listeners know, we have an autonomic nervous system that has a sympathetic and parasympathetic component to it. And they're in balance or imbalance in many diseases, for example. And this interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system drives the switch from left to right nostril. Yeah. Just to remind people, sympathetic nervous system has nothing to do with sympathy, has everything to do with generating patterns of alertness. It's sometimes called the fight or flight system, but any pattern of arousal, positive or negative, and then it's balanced in a coordinated way, or at least in parallel with the parasympathetic nervous system, which is sometimes called the rest and digest system, but is associated with all sorts of things, the sexual arousal response, and a number of other aspects of our physiology. So think of it like a seesaw of alertness and calm. Yeah? Perfect. So now imagine, right? Imagine you would walk around living your life, right?\n------------------------\n",

It's also responsible for falling asleep. It's responsible for us feeling relaxed. It is responsible for most of the states of mind and body in which we are quiescent, where we don't feel an impulse to move, or when we have a difficult time getting into action. So the sympathetic and the parasympathetic aspect of the autonomic nervous system are always in a push-pull with one another. Think of them more or less on a teeter-totter. When one end goes up, the other end goes down. They're really in competition with one another and it's their balance that reflects how alert or how sleepy we happen to be. Now, the reason I'm giving you this rather geeky nerd speak nomenclature filled discussion about the autonomic nervous system in the context of willpower is that regardless of whether or not you believe willpower is a limited or an unlimited resource, we know one thing for sure, and that's that willpower and tenacity ride on our current autonomic function.\n------------------------\n"

That is the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems of your autonomic nervous system are in the best possible balance to generate tenacity and willpower. We don't yet have such a metric, although there are companies that are starting to develop devices that hopefully will give us indices of autonomic function or dysfunction. But it is important that we acknowledge that if you're not taking care of the foundational modulators of tenacity and willpower, none of the subsequent tools and protocols that we will discuss are going to help you that much over time. You might get tenacity and willpower to engage one day when you're very sleep deprived, but it's going to be very difficult to consistently engage tenacity and willpower.

This is super important if you're thinking about tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower. If for instance, you love cold showers and ice baths, well, then it's very unlikely that taking cold showers or getting into an ice bath is going to increase your level of tenacity and willpower further. It might reinforce the tenacity and willpower that you've already built, but it's not going to increase it further. You need to add something or subtract something that makes it harder, not easier to engage in or resist a behavior. Okay, I want to be really clear about this.\n------------------------\n",

So the big takeaway is that if you want to increase your tenacity and willpower, you absolutely can. You can do that by triggering activation of this incredible hub within the brain, the anterior mid-singulate cortex, for which there is now a very large amount of evidence, is at least central to the whole process of generating tenacity and willpower, the I absolutely will do that, and the no, I absolutely won't do that. It's the resistance hub. It's the thing that's allocating resources to do the thing that we don't want to do or that someone's trying to prevent us from doing. It's also the brain area that's allowing us to resist doing the thing that we want to do or that someone else wants us to do when we decide that's not good for us.\n------------------------\n"

Her research has revealed that the amygdala, traditionally associated with fear, is actually involved in reinforcing behaviors and experiences that are positive and involve reward. Dr. Tye's current work investigates social homeostasis, the idea that we have a set point for the amount of social interaction we need, which can vary based on whether we're introverted or extroverted. She has discovered neurons that are active when we feel lonely, suggesting a biological basis for the sensation of loneliness. Her team also explores social hierarchies, the impact of social media, and how these factors affect mental health. The conversation with Dr. Huberman delves into how social interactions, or the lack thereof, can influence our well-being, touching on topics like the neurochemical and hormonal aspects of social behavior.\nShow Guest: Dr. Kay Tye\nTranscript: And I think even if people don't reduce to one hour per week, I think that making some effort toward reducing the amount of incoming, as you said, controlling the top-down inputs to the amygdala, but also to the rest of the brain involved in creative processing, et cetera, is so key. And we actually do have agency. It's just it's tough sometimes to build up that discipline. So you're doing a tremendous service by sharing that somebody as successful as you does this presumably is successful in part because you do this. Could we, by extension, say that many people, since billions of people are on social media, are likely triggering the activation of their amygdala, clouding out other more potentially productive activation of their neural circuits by sort of just making themselves freely available to the thoughts and words and impulses of others? I mean, to me, it seems the answer would be yes, but I'd like to know what you think. I mean, I think, and there's something to be said. There's definitely been moments where I've, you know, gone deep into social media and spent more time in a certain burst, right, that is isolated.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode featuring Dr. Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, the discussion centers on the deep interplay between emotions, social factors, and learning. Dr. Immordino-Yang, an expert in the neuroscience of emotions and learning, explains how our emotional responses and the social environments we grow up in shape our understanding of the world and our self-concepts. The conversation delves into how the education system can influence learning and behavior, highlighting the importance of considering emotional systems as guides for learning and information retention. The episode emphasizes practical applications for parents, educators, and individuals seeking to optimize learning throughout life. It also explores the idea that learning styles vary and that understanding one's emotional responses can enhance the learning experience, whether in traditional or non-traditional settings.\nShow Guest: Dr. Mary Helen Immordino-Yang\nTranscript: Neurobiologically, that situation is inconducive. It is not conducive to being able to actually conjure an alternative perspective in which you construct a meaningful narrative with alternate ethical implications, with alternate prospective possible future outcomes, with alternate views of the historical precedent or context, being able to sort of mentally time travel into the space of those ideas is only really possible when people feel safe to think together. So it sounds like it's anti-creative. Yes. Creativity is also associated with the activations of these networks. Yeah. Causally so in some recent work. I had the good fortune of having dinner last year with somebody. I won't reveal who it is, but he runs a major social media platform. And he told me that in Japan, it's common for people to have two or three or even as many as seven different social media handles. And that they do this in order to embody different versions of themselves safely. So these are not troll accounts. These are not the accounts, and by the way, I see you, troll accounts, that say whatever and then you go to their accounts at some private account where they hide.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab Podcast episode 103, Andrew Huberman discusses the neural mechanisms and processes that underlie creativity. He explains that creativity is not just an abstract concept but is rooted in specific neural circuits that can be activated in a particular sequence to foster creative thinking. Huberman emphasizes that everyone has the capacity for creativity as it stems from a subset of neural structures in the brain. He outlines that creativity involves both divergent thinking, which is generating a wide range of ideas from a single starting point, and convergent thinking, which is narrowing down those ideas to find the most useful and novel ones.\n\nHuberman delves into the role of dopamine in creativity, highlighting two key pathways: the nigrostriatal pathway, which is associated with divergent thinking and movement, and the mesocortical pathway, which is associated with convergent thinking, motivation, and emotion. He suggests that open monitoring meditations can help enhance divergent thinking by allowing for the free flow of thoughts without judgment,\nShow Guest: Andrew Huberman\nTranscript: The first neural circuit involved in creativity is the so-called executive network. This is kind of a goofy name because the neural circuits that I'm about to describe do a bunch of other things as well, but they certainly control what are called executive functions. Executive functions are functions that you and I both have, which is our ability to govern our thinking and our behavior in very deliberate ways. And that is largely accomplished through the use of the neural circuitry that sits right behind the forebrain, the so-called prefrontal cortex. Now the prefrontal cortex involves many different sub-regions. It has a bunch of different parts, just like any country has different states, et cetera, and provinces. Executive function involves the prefrontal cortex and some other neural structures. But for sake of this discussion, executive function and the prefrontal cortex are mainly responsible for suppressing action. That is for eliminating choices among the infinite number of choices that exist.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for reward processing, Dr. Robert Malenka's research found that oxytocin enhances the release of serotonin, which is another neuromodulator involved in mood and social behavior. This finding suggests that oxytocin may play a role in promoting sociability by influencing serotonin levels within the reward circuitry. Oxytocin, often referred to as the \"love hormone,\" has been previously linked to pair bonding and social behaviors in various species, like the prairie vole. Malenka's work explores how positive, pro-social, non-aggressive interactions are highly reinforcing and likely involve the reward circuitry, potentially providing evolutionary advantages in survival, reproduction, and protection from predators. While oxytocin's role in pair bonding has been debated, Malenka's research contributes to the understanding of its function in sociability and its interaction with other neuromodulators like serotonin in the context of the reward system.\nShow Guest: Dr. Robert Malenka\nTranscript: I mean, I think that returning to the issue of autism and the role of serotonin, so in autism, there seems to be less of a reinforcement pathway for certain kinds of social interactions in some individuals with autism. And I'm aware that there are some prescription treatments for autism that capitalize on the serotonergic system and dopamine system. So is it fentamine? To my knowledge, the only FDA-approved pharmacologic therapeutic for individuals with autism spectrum disorder is actually, oh God, I'm just blanking. It's not a serotonergic drug. I have to look it up. I want to say risperidone for agitation. There is no drug for, for lack of a better term, the social deficits. There's no FDA approved drug. If you look at the literature, psychiatrists and individuals with good intention have tested the utility of traditional serotonergic drugs like Prozac, SSRIs. There are drugs known as SNRIs, drugs that influence serotonin release, and another neuromodulator that you know well, norepinephrine, and at least well-done clinical trials, which in my view as an academic are very important. None of them have showed efficacy.\n------------------------\n",
            "\nShow Summary: In the Huberman Lab podcast episode featuring Dr. Sean Mackey, the discussion revolves around the complex nature of pain, its origins, and various methods for managing and reducing pain. Dr. Mackey, a leading expert in pain medicine, clarifies the difference between nociception, the neural processes of encoding and processing noxious stimuli, and the subjective experience of pain. The conversation delves into the critical distinction between physical and emotional pain and how the brain's perception of pain can be influenced by psychological states like anxiety and depression.\n\nDr. Huberman and Dr. Mackey explore the role of the nervous system in chronic pain and discuss behavioral, psychological, nutritional, and pharmacological strategies for pain management. They touch upon the relationship between temperature and pain relief, as well as the controversial use of opioids in clinical settings. The episode also addresses the importance of understanding the distinction between hurt and harm, and how cognitive approaches such as attentional distraction and cognitive reframing can be effective in managing pain.\n\n\nShow Guest: Dr. Sean Mackey\nTranscript: And yes, the medications we have now, you know, we touched base on a few earlier, but we have over 200 medications available for pain. Very few of them FDA approved. We tend to steal from all the other fields. So you're talking about more than 200 medications that can be, yes, prescribed for pain, but as off-label treatments? Perfectly stated, yeah. There's only a few medications that are actually FDA-approved specifically for pain. So what we do is we borrow or steal from the psychiatrists some of their antidepressants, which will frequently work very effectively for pain, and work on those pain-related circuits in the brain. We take from the neurologist some of the anti-seizure medications because those medications, while reducing separately seizures, for people who don't have seizures, they work on ion channels. They work on other neuromodulators that also are involved in pain circuitry. We can take from the cardiologists medications that work on the heart, antiarrhythmia or heart rhythm drugs. They are potent sodium channel blockers. And the sodium channels, as you know, are responsible for the action potential that generates the nerve impulse signal.\n------------------------\n"

            "\nShow Summary: In the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for reward processing, Dr. Robert Malenka's research found that oxytocin enhances the release of serotonin, which is another neuromodulator involved in mood and social behavior. This finding suggests that oxytocin may play a role in promoting sociability by influencing serotonin levels within the reward circuitry. Oxytocin, often referred to as the \"love hormone,\" has been previously linked to pair bonding and social behaviors in various species, like the prairie vole. Malenka's work explores how positive, pro-social, non-aggressive interactions are highly reinforcing and likely involve the reward circuitry, potentially providing evolutionary advantages in survival, reproduction, and protection from predators. While oxytocin's role in pair bonding has been debated, Malenka's research contributes to the understanding of its function in sociability and its interaction with other neuromodulators like serotonin in the context of the reward system.\nShow Guest: Dr. Robert Malenka\nTranscript: I mean, I think that returning to the issue of autism and the role of serotonin, so in autism, there seems to be less of a reinforcement pathway for certain kinds of social interactions in some individuals with autism. And I'm aware that there are some prescription treatments for autism that capitalize on the serotonergic system and dopamine system. So is it fentamine? To my knowledge, the only FDA-approved pharmacologic therapeutic for individuals with autism spectrum disorder is actually, oh God, I'm just blanking. It's not a serotonergic drug. I have to look it up. I want to say risperidone for agitation. There is no drug for, for lack of a better term, the social deficits. There's no FDA approved drug. If you look at the literature, psychiatrists and individuals with good intention have tested the utility of traditional serotonergic drugs like Prozac, SSRIs. There are drugs known as SNRIs, drugs that influence serotonin release, and another neuromodulator that you know well, norepinephrine, and at least well-done clinical trials, which in my view as an academic are very important. None of them have showed efficacy.\n------------------------\n",

And that's the importance, in my view, of the kind of mechanistic work my lab and many other labs around the country are doing. Even if we don't have a detailed understanding of how it's all happening, we can identify drugs and druggable targets or even behavioral interventions that might actually help people. For example, suffering from autism spectrum disorder of the sort that they actually want and need therapeutic help. I think looking at the social connection circuitry through the lens of autism is going to be very interesting for us to do. I do have a question about what is being selected for in rewarding social interactions? Because obviously we are living in a time where we don't have to aggregate in groups necessarily to protect ourselves physically.\n------------------------\n"
